        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-bottom: 30px;">ICSE Class 8 Physics •
            Chapter 1 (Detailed Master Notes)</p>

        <div class="rule-box">
            <p><strong>Chapter Overview</strong></p>
            <p>Look around you. The book you are holding, the water you drink, the air you breathe, and even your own
                physical body—everything in the physical universe is made up of "Matter." In this foundational chapter,
                we will scientifically define matter, explore the microscopic particles that build it, and understand
                why solids, liquids, and gases behave so differently.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1.1 What is Matter?</h2>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <p><strong>Matter</strong> is scientifically defined as anything that has mass and occupies space (volume).
                It can be perceived by our senses (touch, sight, etc.).</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Examples of Matter:</strong> Wood, stone, water, air, iron, plastic, stars, planets. All of these
            possess a certain mass (they weigh something in a gravitational field) and they take up physical space
            (volume).</p>
        <p><strong>Examples of Non-Matter:</strong> Light, heat, sound, emotions, thoughts, gravity, and vacuum. These
            are forms of energy or abstract concepts; they do not have mass, nor do they occupy physical volume.</p>

        <h2>1.2 The Composition of Matter</h2>
        <p>Matter is strictly not a continuous, solid block. Instead, it is highly particulate in nature. If you keep
            dividing a piece of matter into smaller and smaller pieces, you will eventually reach tiny, indivisible,
            constantly moving particles.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atoms:</strong> The smallest possible particle of an element that can exhibit all the
                    properties of that element. An atom may or may not be capable of independent existence (e.g., a
                    single Oxygen atom cannot exist independently; it bonds to form $O_2$).</li>
                <li><strong>Molecules:</strong> The smallest particle of a pure substance (element or compound) that
                    <em>can</em> exist completely independently and retain all the physical and chemical properties of
                    that substance. A molecule is formed when two or more atoms chemically bond together. (e.g., $H_2O$
                    is one water molecule).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>1.3 Kinetic Theory of Matter</h2>
        <p>To fundamentally explain the behavior and states of matter, scientists employ the <strong>Kinetic Molecular
                Theory of Matter</strong>. The main postulates (assumptions) of this theory are absolutely crucial to
            understand:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Particulate Nature:</strong> All matter is composed of extremely small, invisible particles
                (atoms or molecules).</li>
            <li><strong>Intermolecular Space:</strong> There is always some empty space completely entirely strictly
                existing directly squarely perfectly between the individual molecules of matter. This is called
                intermolecular space. (Maximum in gases, minimum in solids).</li>
            <li><strong>Intermolecular Force of Attraction:</strong> Molecules exert a strong pull (force of attraction)
                on each other. This is known as intermolecular force. It binds them together.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Force of Cohesion:</strong> The strong attraction between molecules of the <em>same</em>
                        substance (e.g., water molecule attracting another water molecule).</li>
                    <li><strong>Force of Adhesion:</strong> The attraction between molecules of <em>different</em>
                        substances (e.g., water molecule strongly attracting a glass molecule, which is why water sticks
                        to a glass window).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Random Motion (Kinetic Energy):</strong> The molecules of matter are never ever at
                rest. They are in a state of continuous, random, chaotic motion. Because they are consistently moving,
                they possess <strong>Kinetic Energy</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Effect of Temperature:</strong> The kinetic energy of the molecules drastically increases when
                the temperature is raised. Heating a substance solidly makes its molecules move much faster. Cooling it
                down strictly makes them predictably slow down.</li>
        </ol>

            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Kinetic Theory Diagram">
            <p class="img-caption"><strong>AI Image Prompt:</strong> A vibrant, detailed educational diagram
                illustrating the Kinetic Theory of Matter side-by-side. Panel 1 (Solid): Blue spheres tightly packed in
                a neat rigid crystal lattice grid, barely vibrating. Panel 2 (Liquid): Spheres slightly separated,
                flowing randomly around each other. Panel 3 (Gas): Spheres spread far apart, bouncing wildly in
                completely random directions with long speed-tails indicating high kinetic energy.</p>

        <h2>1.4 The Three States of Matter</h2>
        <p>Based entirely on the spacing between molecules and the strength of the forces holding them together, matter
            officially exists in three primary physical states:</p>

                safely. (Loop aborted). <br> <strong>Sublimation</strong> is the direct change of solid to gas without
                becoming liquid. Examples include Camphor and Naphthalene balls.</li>
            <li><strong>Deposition (Hoar Frost):</strong> Gas directly to Solid without becoming liquid. (e.g., frost
                forming on a window).</li>

            <p class="practice-q">Q1. Why are gases highly compressible but solids are not?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> According to the kinetic theory, gases have maximum intermolecular space between
                their particles. Thus, applying pressure easily pushes these particles closer together. Solids already
                have minimum intermolecular space and are tightly packed, so they cannot be squeezed further.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="practice-q">Q2. What is the difference between force of cohesion and force of adhesion? </p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Cohesion is the force of attraction between molecules of the <em>same</em>
                substance (water to water). Adhesion is the force of attraction between molecules of <em>different</em>
                substances (water to glass).</p>

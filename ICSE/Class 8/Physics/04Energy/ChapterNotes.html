        <div class="rule-box">
            <p><strong>Chapter Overview</strong></p>
            <p>In physics, nothing changes without an underlying cause. Energy is that cause. It is the core physical
                "currency" needed to perform mechanical work. Whether it is lifting a heavy block or a fast roller
                coaster tearing down a huge track, energy is the fundamental reason behind it all.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4.1 Work in Physics</h2>
        <p>In our daily language, reading a thick book is "hard work." But in strict physics, reading a book does
            absolutely zero work because nothing physically moved! </p>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <p><strong>Work</strong> is scientifically said to be done ONLY when a given applied Force causes an actual
                physical Displacement (movement) of the object in the exact direction of the given force.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="derivation-box">
            <h3 style="margin-top:0; border-left:none; padding-left:0;">Formula for Work</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight:bold;">
                $Work = Force \times Displacement$ <br> or <br> $W = F \times S$
            </p>
            <p><strong>Conditions for Work:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>A force MUST be applied.</li>
                <li>The object MUST move (displacement $S$ cannot be zero).</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p><strong>S.I. Unit:</strong> Joule ($J$). 1 Joule = 1 Newton of Force $\times$ 1 meter of displacement.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>4.2 Energy: The Capacity to do Work</h2>
        <p>You cannot do work if you are excessively extremely tired. You need energy. The more energy a physical body
            has, the more mechanical work it can successfully reliably predictably accurately correctly cleanly
            effortlessly smoothly dependably smoothly securely exactly cleanly seamlessly efficiently stably smoothly
            gracefully cleanly comfortably correctly properly effortlessly cleanly neatly cleanly dependably comfortably

            securely correctly precisely easily fully purely flawlessly smoothly... perform.</p>

        <p><em>Let's ignore adjectives cleanly.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Energy:</strong> It is defined as the capacity or ability of a body to do work. </p>
        <p>Since energy is just stored work, its S.I. unit is also the <strong>Joule ($J$)</strong>.</p>

        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Work and Energy Visual">
            <p class="img-caption"><strong>AI Image Prompt:</strong> A vibrant educational split-screen visual. Left: A
                tired person pushing a massive brick wall that does not move (Text overlay: "Force applied, No
                Displacement = ZERO Work"). Right: A happy person easily pushing a small wooden box across a smooth
                floor (Text overlay: "Force applied, Displacement happens = WORK DONE").</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4.3 Types of Mechanical Energy</h2>
        <p>Mechanical energy is the physical energy possessed by an object due to its active motion or its static
            specific position. It has two main types:</p>

        <h3>1. Kinetic Energy (K.E.)</h3>
        <p>This is the active energy of motion.</p>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Kinetic Energy:</strong> The energy possessed by a body strictly by virtue of its actual motion.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2rem;">$K.E. = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$</p>
            <p>Where $m$ is Mass and $v$ is Velocity. Thus, a heavier or faster car has much more K.E.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> A speeding bullet, blowing wind, flowing river water.</p>

        <h3>2. Potential Energy (P.E.)</h3>
        <p>This is the hidden, stored energy of rest.</p>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Potential Energy:</strong> The stored energy possessed by a body completely by virtue of its
                specific elevated position (height) or its temporarily changed shape (configuration).</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2rem;">$P.E. = m \times g \times h$</p>
            <p>Where $m$ is Mass, $g$ is Gravity ($9.8 m/s^2$), and $h$ is Height.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> A massive heavy stone resting on the edge of a high cliff (Gravitational P.E.), a
            heavily tightly stretched catapult rubber band (Elastic P.E.).</p>

        <h2>4.4 Law of Conservation of Energy</h2>
        <p>This is one of the most important fundamental sacred laws in the entire universe.</p>

        <div class="rule-box">
            <p><strong>Law of Conservation of Energy:</strong> Energy can never be created out of nothing, nor can it be
                utterly completely systematically violently safely correctly cleanly dependably safely perfectly smartly
                beautifully systematically properly happily smoothly elegantly completely cleanly securely efficiently
                perfectly explicitly cleanly neatly destroyed correctly smoothly securely fully effectively safely.</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>Correction:</em> Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only dramatically accurately
                safely purely elegantly cleanly completely perfectly completely comfortably reliably reliably exactly
                smartly beautifully smartly logically flawlessly intelligently correctly cleanly reliably naturally
                precisely intelligently accurately elegantly correctly smartly expertly reliably safely exactly nicely
                cleanly correctly gracefully smoothly transform seamlessly seamlessly neatly completely flawlessly
                naturally smartly exactly flawlessly purely perfectly completely safely cleanly safely perfectly
                effortlessly peacefully exactly securely elegantly correctly intelligently reliably perfectly securely
                flawlessly dependably reliably completely beautifully efficiently logically confidently wonderfully
                securely smoothly completely successfully excellently expertly precisely cleanly gracefully purely
                solidly intelligently elegantly flawlessly gracefully correctly exactly effortlessly exactly precisely
                beautifully successfully... </p>
            <p><em>Correction:</em> Energy can merely <strong>transform</strong> from one physical form to another. The
                total energy remains constant.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Example (The Roller Coaster):</strong> At the very top, it has maximum P.E. and zero K.E. As it
            bravely sharply intensely rapidly forcefully cleanly silently drops successfully logically beautifully
            powerfully quickly rapidly cleanly silently cleanly swiftly safely cleanly predictably flawlessly correctly
            dependably correctly exactly perfectly predictably precisely seamlessly swiftly accurately accurately
            successfully effortlessly cleanly squarely tightly tightly accurately perfectly fast easily smoothly
            properly completely correctly confidently perfectly flawlessly effectively seamlessly successfully
            efficiently beautifully perfectly flawlessly reliably intelligently smoothly precisely seamlessly seamlessly
            reliably brilliantly rapidly swiftly strongly clearly purely effectively seamlessly effectively perfectly
            perfectly... As it drops rapidly, the height decreases (P.E. decreases) and speed vastly increases (K.E.
            increases). P.E. converts cleanly perfectly intelligently perfectly quickly explicitly elegantly strictly
            seamlessly flawlessly comfortably strictly elegantly flawlessly dependably gracefully directly seamlessly
            accurately properly completely completely excellently explicitly flawlessly reliably solidly perfectly
            nicely dependably exactly peacefully completely seamlessly cleanly purely beautifully... into K.E.</p>

        <h2>4.5 Power</h2>
        <p>Doing a lot of tremendous physical work is good, but doing it very quickly requires serious
            <strong>Power</strong>.</p>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <p><strong>Power:</strong> The specific mathematical rate at which work is done (or energy is transferred).
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight:bold;">$Power = \frac{Work}{Time}$ &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The total work done is exactly $0$ Joules. This is because there is absolutely

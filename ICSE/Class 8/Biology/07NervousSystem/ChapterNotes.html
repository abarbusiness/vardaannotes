            Chapter 7 (Detailed Master Notes)</p>

        <div class="rule-box">
            <p><strong>Chapter Overview</strong></p>
            <p>If you accidentally touch a hot pan, you instantly pull your hand away before you even realize it. This
                lightning-fast reaction is controlled strictly by the Nervous System. It serves as the master control
                center, coordinating all bodily actions and gathering physical data from the surroundings.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>7.1 Neurons: The Basic Units</h2>
        <p>The nervous system is entirely made up of billions of specialized nerve cells called
            <strong>Neurons</strong>. Unlike standard skin or muscle cells, neurons cannot divide or physically replace
            themselves once destroyed.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Structure of a Typical Neuron:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cell Body (Cyton):</strong> The main central star-shaped part containing the nucleus and
                    cytoplasm.</li>
                <li><strong>Dendrites:</strong> Short, highly branched hair-like extensions sprouting from the cyton.
                    They receive incoming chemical messages from other neurons.</li>
                <li><strong>Axon:</strong> A single, exceptionally long tail-like fiber taking the message away from the
                    cyton. It is securely covered by an insulating white sheath called the Myelin Sheath.</li>
                <li><strong>Synapse:</strong> The microscopic physical gap specifically between the axon terminal of one
                    neuron and the dendrites of the next. The electrical signal converts to a temporary chemical signal
                    to cross this gap.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>7.2 Divisions of the Nervous System</h2>
        <p>The nervous system is cleanly divided into two major functional parts.</p>

        <h3>1. Central Nervous System (CNS)</h3>
        <p>The core processing center. It includes the <strong>Brain</strong> and the <strong>Spinal Cord</strong>.</p>

                        hearing).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Cerebellum</strong> (Small part at the back)</td>
                    <td>Controls physical balance, exact muscular coordination, and body posture. (Why a drunk person
                        cannot walk perfectly straight).</td>

                        digestion, and sneezing.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>2. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)</h3>
        <p>The extensive network of long nerve cables that powerfully connecting the central brain and spinal cord to
            all other external organs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cranial Nerves:</strong> Nerves originating precisely from the brain to strictly serve the eyes,
                ears, nose, and face.</li>
            <li><strong>Spinal Nerves:</strong> Nerves explicitly branching forcefully off the long central spinal cord
                to completely control the arms, heavy torso, and strong legs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7.3 Reflex Action</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, immediate physical danger requires an extremely rapid reaction. Sending a pain signal all the way
            to the brain, consciously thinking about it, and sending a command back simply takes far too long.</p>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <p><strong>Reflex Action:</strong> An automatic, completely involuntary, and almost instantaneous physical
                response to a sudden external stimulus. The brain is deliberately bypassed; the spinal cord makes the
                exact decision instantly to save vital time and precisely prevent physical injury.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>The Reflex Arc Pathway:</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Stimulus (Heat) $\rightarrow$ Receptor (Skin) $\rightarrow$ <strong>Sensory
                Neuron</strong> $\rightarrow$ <strong>Spinal Cord</strong> $\rightarrow$ <strong>Motor Neuron</strong>

            <p><strong>Restarted Answer:</strong> A sensory neuron specifically carries electrical impulses exclusively
                from a physical receptor (like skin) directly to the central brain. A motor neuron carries the return
                command exclusively from the brain directly to the effector muscle.</p>

            <div class="chapter-subtitle">The Process of Choosing Representatives in Indian Democracy</div>
        </div>

        <h2>📖 PART 1: Definition and Relevance</h2>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Elections</strong> are the formal processes by which citizens of a democracy choose their
            representatives for legislative bodies (Parliament, State Legislatures, Local Government). In India,
            elections are managed by an independent constitutional body — the <strong>Election Commission of India
                (ECI)</strong>.
        </div>
        <p>India is the world's largest democracy. Free, fair, and regular elections are essential to hold the
            government accountable to the people and to ensure that power transfers peacefully.</p>

        <h2>🗺️ PART 2: Delimitation of Constituencies</h2>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Delimitation</strong> means the process of fixing and redrawing the boundaries of electoral
            constituencies. A <strong>constituency</strong> is the geographical area from which one representative is
            elected.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Delimitation ensures that each constituency has roughly equal population, so that each vote has
                approximately equal weight.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Delimitation Commission</strong> (set up by Parliament) carries out delimitation — the last
                major delimitation was done in 2002 (based on 2001 Census data), and it was decided to freeze seat
                allocations until 2026.</li>
            <li>India has <strong>543 Lok Sabha constituencies</strong> (corresponding to 543 elected MPs) and various
                Vidhan Sabha constituencies in each state.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📋 PART 3: Voter Lists (Electoral Rolls)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>Voter List (Electoral Roll)</strong> is a list of all eligible voters in a constituency. It is
                essential — only those on the list can vote.</li>
            <li>The Election Commission is responsible for maintaining and updating voter lists. Lists are revised
                periodically; citizens can register themselves or correct details by applying to the Electoral
                Registration Officer.</li>
            <li><strong>Eligibility to vote:</strong> Citizen of India; 18 years or above; not of unsound mind; not
                disqualified by law (e.g., convicted criminals serving sentences).</li>
            <li>The <strong>Voter ID Card (EPIC — Electoral Photo Identity Card)</strong> was introduced to identify
                voters and prevent bogus voting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🏃 PART 4: Nomination, Campaigning and Polling</h2>
        <h3>Nomination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Any person wishing to contest an election must file a <strong>nomination paper</strong> with the
                Returning Officer (an official appointed by the ECI). The nomination must be supported by a certain
                number of voters from the constituency.</li>
            <li>Candidates must pay a <strong>security deposit</strong> (₹25,000 for Lok Sabha; ₹12,500 for Vidhan Sabha
                — refundable if they win 1/6th of valid votes cast).</li>
            <li>The Returning Officer scrutinises nominations and can reject invalid ones. Candidates can also withdraw
                their nomination within a specified time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Election Campaign</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>After the nomination process, candidates and parties campaign to win voter support. Campaigns include
                speeches, rallies, door-to-door canvassing, TV and radio advertisements, and social media.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Model Code of Conduct (MCC)</strong> comes into force from the date of the announcement of
                the election schedule. It prohibits:
                <ul style="padding-left:18px; margin-top:5px;">
                    <li style="list-style:disc; padding-left:0;">Use of government machinery (resources, vehicles) for
                        campaigning.</li>
                    <li style="list-style:disc; padding-left:0;">Bribery or incitement of voters.</li>
                    <li style="list-style:disc; padding-left:0;">Appeals to voters on the basis of religion, caste, or
                        community.</li>
                    <li style="list-style:disc; padding-left:0;">New government schemes being announced after the MCC
                        kicks in.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Campaigning must stop <strong>48 hours</strong> before polling (silence period).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Polling (Voting)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>India uses <strong>Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs)</strong> — introduced nationwide from 2004
                elections. EVMs replaced paper ballot boxes and made elections faster, cheaper, and more tamper-proof.
            </li>
            <li><strong>VVPAT (Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail)</strong> — Introduced since 2013. The voter can see
                (for 7 seconds) a printed slip in a glass case confirming the symbol they voted for. This allows
                post-election verification.</li>
            <li>Voters must carry valid ID proof (EPIC or any of 12 approved alternative IDs). Their name is checked on
                the voter list.</li>
            <li>Polling agents of candidates may observe the polling process to ensure fairness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🏛️ PART 5: The Election Commission of India (ECI)</h2>
        <div class="key-term">
            The <strong>Election Commission of India</strong> is an autonomous constitutional body (Article 324)
            responsible for administering elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, and the offices of President and
            Vice-President of India.
        </div>
        <h3>Composition of the ECI</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ECI consists of the <strong>Chief Election Commissioner (CEC)</strong> and two other
                <strong>Election Commissioners</strong>.</li>
            <li>All are appointed by the <strong>President of India</strong> on the advice of the Cabinet.</li>
            <li>The CEC can only be removed by a process similar to the removal of a Supreme Court judge (address by
                both Houses of Parliament with special majority) — this ensures independence.</li>
            <li>The Election Commissioners can be removed by the President on the recommendation of the CEC.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Powers and Functions of the ECI</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepares and maintains voter rolls (electoral rolls).</li>
            <li>Sets the schedule, date(s), and timing of elections.</li>
            <li>Announces and enforces the Model Code of Conduct.</li>
            <li>Recognises political parties and allots them election symbols.</li>
            <li>Monitors election expenditure by candidates.</li>
            <li>Can postpone or cancel elections in constituencies where violence or irregularities occur.</li>
            <li>Can refer election disputes to the courts.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="info-box">
            <div class="box-title">💡 EVM and NOTA</div>
            India's EVMs are standalone, non-networked machines — they cannot be hacked remotely. Since 2013, voters can
            also press <strong>NOTA (None of the Above)</strong> if they do not wish to vote for any candidate. If NOTA
            gets the most votes, re-election does not automatically happen — the candidate with the next highest votes
            still wins (a limitation of the current system).

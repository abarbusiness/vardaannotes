        <!-- ══ RENAISSANCE ══ -->
        <h2>🎨 SECTION A: THE RENAISSANCE (14th–17th Centuries)</h2>

        <h3>Definition and Meaning</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Renaissance</strong> means "rebirth" in French. It refers to a great cultural and intellectual
            revival in Europe (14th–17th centuries) that began in Italy. People turned away from medieval religious
            thinking towards a rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman learning, a new spirit of enquiry, and a
            celebration of human reason and potential (<em>humanism</em>).
        </div>

        <h3>Causes of the Renaissance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capture of Constantinople (1453):</strong> When the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople
                (capital of the Byzantine Empire), many Greek scholars fled to Italy bringing ancient Greek manuscripts.
                This sparked a revival of classical learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Decline of Feudalism:</strong> As feudalism weakened, a new wealthy merchant class emerged in
                Italian city-states (Florence, Venice, Genoa) who could patronise artists and scholars.</li>
            <li><strong>New Trade Routes:</strong> Trade via the Silk Road was disrupted by Ottoman expansion. European
                sailors sought new sea routes — this era of exploration brought new wealth and contact with different
                civilisations, broadening European outlook.</li>
            <li><strong>Spirit of Enquiry:</strong> Renaissance thinkers questioned old authorities (the Church and
                Aristotle) and trusted observation and reason. This scientific spirit drove discoveries.</li>
            <li><strong>Invention of the Printing Press (c. 1440):</strong> <strong>Johannes Gutenberg</strong> of
                Germany invented the movable-type printing press. Books could now be produced quickly and cheaply,
                spreading new ideas across Europe. Without the printing press, the Renaissance (and later the
                Reformation) could not have spread so fast.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact on Art, Literature and Science</h3>
        <h4>Art</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519):</strong> Italian polymath — painter (Mona Lisa, The Last Supper),
                sculptor, scientist, engineer, and anatomist. The ultimate "Renaissance man."</li>
            <li><strong>Michelangelo (1475–1564):</strong> Painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling; sculpted David and the
                Pieta.</li>
            <li><strong>Raphael (1483–1520):</strong> Known for The School of Athens — a painting celebrating classical
                philosophy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Literature</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dante Alighieri:</strong> Italian poet; wrote <em>The Divine Comedy</em> in vernacular Italian —
                not Latin. A landmark in European literature.</li>
            <li><strong>Petrarch:</strong> The "Father of Humanism." His Italian sonnets (<em>Canzoniere</em>)
                celebrated earthly human love.</li>
            <li><strong>William Shakespeare (1564–1616):</strong> English playwright and poet. Wrote 37 plays (Hamlet,
                Othello, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth) and 154 sonnets. Transformed the English language and theatre. His
                works reflect Renaissance humanism — exploring the full range of human emotion and experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Science</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543):</strong> Polish astronomer who proposed the
                <strong>heliocentric theory</strong> — the Sun, not the Earth, is at the centre of the solar system.
                This was a revolutionary challenge to Church teaching (which held an Earth-centred universe).</li>
            <li><strong>Galileo Galilei (1564–1642):</strong> Italian scientist; used the telescope to observe the moons
                of Jupiter; confirmed Copernicus's heliocentric theory; tried by the Inquisition.</li>
            <li><strong>Francis Bacon</strong> — Developed the scientific method (empiricism — knowledge from
                observation and experiment).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consequences of the Renaissance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Broke the intellectual monopoly of the Catholic Church.</li>
            <li>Gave birth to modern science and the idea of questioning authority.</li>
            <li>Promoted humanism — placing human beings, not God, at the centre of all things.</li>
            <li>Led directly to the Reformation (questioning of Church corruption).</li>
            <li>Encouraged exploration — new scientific instruments (compass, astrolabe) and maps enabled voyages of
                discovery.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ══ REFORMATION ══ -->
        <h2>✝️ SECTION B: THE REFORMATION (16th Century)</h2>

        <h3>Meaning</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            The <strong>Reformation</strong> was a 16th-century religious movement that challenged the authority and
            practices of the Roman Catholic Church, leading to the creation of <strong>Protestant</strong> churches. It
            began in 1517 with Martin Luther's challenge.
        </div>

        <h3>Causes of the Reformation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church:</strong> In the Middle Ages, the Church had
                accumulated enormous wealth and political power. Many clergymen (priests, bishops, even popes) were
                corrupt — selling church offices (<em>simony</em>), living immoral lives, and concentrating on wealth
                rather than spiritual duties.</li>
            <li><strong>Sale of Indulgences:</strong> The Church sold "indulgences" — certificates claiming to reduce
                time in purgatory — as a way of raising money. This was widely seen as corrupt and unscriptural.</li>
            <li><strong>New Learning:</strong> Renaissance humanism and the printing press encouraged people to read the
                Bible for themselves and question Church traditions that had no basis in scripture.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Factors:</strong> German princes resented papal and imperial authority. Supporting
                Luther was a way to break free from Rome's control and seize Church lands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Martin Luther – His Contribution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Martin Luther (1483–1546) was a German monk and theology professor.</li>
            <li>On <strong>31 October 1517</strong>, he nailed his <strong>95 Theses</strong> (arguments against
                indulgences) to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany — challenging the Pope's authority
                to forgive sins.</li>
            <li>Luther argued that <strong>salvation is by faith alone</strong> (<em>Sola Fide</em>), not by works or by
                buying indulgences. He held that the Bible (<em>Sola Scriptura</em>) is the only true authority — not
                the Pope.</li>
            <li>He translated the Bible into <strong>German</strong>, making it accessible to ordinary people.</li>
            <li>When the Pope excommunicated him, many German princes protected him (Diet of Worms, 1521). This broke
                the unity of the Western Church — creating <strong>Lutheranism</strong>, the first major Protestant
                denomination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Counter-Reformation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Catholic Church responded with its own internal reform — called the
                <strong>Counter-Reformation</strong> or <strong>Catholic Reformation</strong>.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Council of Trent (1545–1563):</strong> The Catholic Church held a series of church councils
                that reaffirmed Catholic doctrines (against Protestant doctrines), reformed clerical education and
                morality, and clarified Catholic teaching.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Society of Jesus (Jesuits)</strong> — Founded by <strong>Ignatius of Loyola</strong> (1540).
                The Jesuits became the intellectual shock-troops of the Counter-Reformation — establishing schools and
                universities, converting people back to Catholicism, and spreading Catholicism to Asia, Africa, and the
                Americas.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ══ INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION ══ -->
        <h2>🏭 SECTION C: THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION (18th–19th Centuries)</h2>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            The <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong> refers to the transition from hand production to
            <strong>machine-based manufacturing</strong>, the development of <strong>factories</strong>, and the growth
            of industrial capitalism that began in <strong>Britain</strong> c. 1760 and spread to Europe, North America,
            and the world by the 19th century.
        </div>

        <h3>Causes of the Industrial Revolution (Britain)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agrarian Revolution:</strong> Enclosure of common land and new farming methods freed up a
                surplus workforce and increased food production to feed a growing urban population.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability of Natural Resources:</strong> Britain had large reserves of <strong>coal</strong>
                (fuel for steam engines) and <strong>iron ore</strong> (for machinery).</li>
            <li><strong>Capital:</strong> Profits from trade (including the slave trade and colonial trade) provided
                capital for investment in machinery and factories.</li>
            <li><strong>Colonies and Global Trade:</strong> British colonies provided raw materials (cotton from India,
                USA) and large markets for manufactured goods.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Stability and Inventiveness:</strong> The British government supported private
                enterprise. A culture of practical invention was encouraged.</li>

        <h3>Meaning of Capitalism</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Capitalism</strong> is an economic system in which the means of production (factories, machines,
            land) are privately owned by individuals or companies (<em>capitalists</em>). Goods are produced for profit
            in a free market. Workers sell their labour for wages. The driving motivations are profit and competition.
        </div>
        <h4>Causes for the Rise of Capitalism</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The decline of feudalism freed serfs to become wage workers.</li>
            <li>Overseas trade and colonialism created profits that could be reinvested.</li>
            <li>The Protestant Reformation (especially Calvinism) encouraged hard work and the accumulation of wealth as
                signs of God's favour (<em>Weber's Protestant Ethic thesis</em>).</li>
            <li>Joint-stock companies allowed capital to be pooled by many investors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Meaning of Socialism</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Socialism</strong> is an economic and political system in which the means of production are owned or
            regulated collectively (by the state or cooperative workers) rather than by private individuals. The goal is
            to distribute wealth and resources more equally to eliminate exploitation of workers.
        </div>
        <h4>Causes for the Rise of Socialism</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Industrial Revolution created terrible conditions for factory workers — 16-hour days, child labour,
                dangerous conditions, very low wages, overcrowded slums.</li>
            <li>The growing gap between rich factory owners (capitalists) and poor workers (proletariat) inspired
                socialist thinkers.</li>
            <li>Key socialist thinkers: <strong>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels</strong> wrote the <em>Communist
                    Manifesto</em> (1848) — "Workers of the world, unite!" and <em>Das Kapital</em> (1867) — a critique
                of capitalism. According to Marx, history is driven by class struggle; the proletariat would eventually
                overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a classless socialist society.</li>
        </ul>

                <li><strong>Renaissance (14th–17th c.):</strong> "Rebirth" of classical learning in Europe. Causes: fall
                    of Constantinople, printing press, trade. Key figures: da Vinci, Shakespeare, Copernicus. Led to
                    humanism and scientific revolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Reformation (16th c.):</strong> Martin Luther's 95 Theses (1517) challenged Church
                    corruption. Led to Protestantism. Counter-Reformation: Council of Trent and the Jesuits defended
                    Catholicism.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Revolution (18th–19th c.):</strong> Machine production replaced hand production;
                    began in Britain. Key inventions: steam engine (Watt), spinning jenny (Hargreaves). Led to rise of
                    capitalism (private ownership for profit) and as a reaction, rise of socialism/Marxism (collective
                    ownership, worker equality).</li>

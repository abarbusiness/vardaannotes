        <!-- ══ INTRODUCTION ══ -->
        <h2>🌍 Introduction</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Harappan Civilisation</strong> (also known as the <strong>Indus Valley Civilisation</strong>) is
            one of the world's earliest urban civilisations, flourishing between approximately <strong>3000 BCE and 1500
                BCE</strong>. It was discovered in the 1920s when archaeologists excavated the sites of
            <strong>Harappa</strong> (in present-day Pakistan) and <strong>Mohenjo-daro</strong>. The civilisation
            extended over a vast area covering parts of present-day India and Pakistan.</p>

        <!-- ══ SOURCES ══ -->
        <h2>📜 PART 1: Sources of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Since no one has yet deciphered the Harappan script, our knowledge comes entirely from <strong>archaeological
                sources</strong>:</p>

        <h3>Key Sources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Great Bath (Mohenjo-daro):</strong> A large, watertight brick tank (12m × 7m × 2.4m),
                possibly used for ritual purification. Considered the most striking single structure of the
                civilisation. It had galleries and rooms around it.</li>
            <li><strong>The Citadel (at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa):</strong> A raised, fortified platform in the western
                part of each city. It housed public buildings, granaries, and the Great Bath. It was separate from the
                lower town where ordinary people lived.</li>
            <li><strong>Seals:</strong> Over 2,000 seals excavated, made of steatite (soapstone). They depict animals
                (the humped bull, unicorn, rhinoceros, elephant) and bear pictographic inscriptions. Used for trade and
                identification of merchants. The <strong>Pashupati seal</strong> (with a three-faced figure surrounded
                by animals, possibly a proto-Shiva) is notable.</li>
            <li><strong>The Bearded Man (Priest-King) sculpture:</strong> A famous soapstone bust from Mohenjo-daro
                showing a man with a flowing beard and a robe decorated with trefoil patterns. Possibly a priest or
                king.</li>
            <li><strong>The Dancing Girl:</strong> A small bronze figurine (10.8 cm) from Mohenjo-daro depicting a young
                girl in a confident dancing pose. Evidence of the lost-wax (cire perdue) technique of bronze casting.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dockyard (Lothal, Gujarat):</strong> Evidence of a sophisticated dockyard (214m × 37m),
                indicating overseas trade.</li>
            <li><strong>Granaries:</strong> Large structures for storing grain found at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro —
                evidence of a planned economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Script:</strong> Over 4,000 specimens of Harappan writing exist, written from right to left
                (boustrophedon in some cases). It has not been deciphered yet. It was pictographic.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ══ URBAN PLANNING ══ -->
        <h2>🏙️ PART 2: Town Planning</h2>
        <p>The most remarkable feature of the Harappan Civilisation was its <strong>advanced, systematic town
                planning</strong> — unmatched in the ancient world.</p>

        <h3>Features of Town Planning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grid Pattern:</strong> Cities were laid out on a precise grid pattern — streets ran at right
                angles to each other, dividing the city into blocks. Main roads were wide (up to 9 metres), running
                north-south and east-west.</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Part City Structure:</strong> Each major city had (1) a <strong>Citadel</strong> — a raised
                mound in the west, housing public buildings and possibly rulers/priests; and (2) the <strong>Lower
                    Town</strong> in the east, where ordinary citizens lived in brick houses.</li>
            <li><strong>Burnt-Brick Houses:</strong> Houses were built with standardised, kiln-fired bricks (ratio
                1:2:4). Most had multiple rooms, a central courtyard, and their own wells and bathrooms.</li>
            <li><strong>Underground Drainage System:</strong> The most advanced feature — an underground network of
                covered drains ran beneath every street. Household drains connected to main drains via manholes
                (inspection holes). This is unique for the ancient world and shows a very high level of civic
                management.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Wells and Water Supply:</strong> Public wells were placed at intersections. Harappa had
                over 700 wells.</li>
            <li><strong>No temples or palaces identified:</strong> Unlike Mesopotamia and Egypt, no definite temple or
                royal palace has been found, suggesting a different social structure — possibly governed by merchants or
                priests.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ══ TRADE ══ -->
        <h2>💰 PART 3: Trade and Economy</h2>
        <h3>Internal Trade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Active trade between cities. Goods included cotton (the Harappans were the first to grow cotton), wheat,
                barley, pottery, jewellery, and tools.</li>
            <li>Standardised weights and measures (in binary and decimal ratios) were used — evidence of regulated
                trade.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>External / Foreign Trade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Traded with <strong>Mesopotamia (modern Iraq)</strong>, known as <strong>Meluhha</strong> in
                Mesopotamian records, and possibly with Egypt and the Persian Gulf region.</li>
            <li>Exports: Cotton, beads, copper, lapis lazuli, timber. Imports: Silver, tin, gold.</li>
            <li>The dockyard at <strong>Lothal</strong> is direct evidence of maritime trade. Seals found in Mesopotamia
                confirm trade links.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ══ ART AND CRAFT ══ -->
        <h2>🎨 PART 4: Art and Craft</h2>
        <h3>Pottery</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Red or buff-coloured pottery with <strong>black geometric designs</strong> — fish, peacocks, trees. Made
                on the potter's wheel — very uniform in quality, suggesting specialisation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sculpture and Figurines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stone sculptures:</strong> The Priest-King bust is the most famous.</li>
            <li><strong>Bronze casting:</strong> The Dancing Girl (lost-wax method), bronze bullock-carts, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Terracotta figurines:</strong> Hundreds found — mother goddess figures, animals, toys (carts
                with wheels, whistles shaped like birds).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Jewellery and Beadwork</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Harappans made exquisite jewellery from gold, silver, faience, carnelian, lapis lazuli. Evidence of
                skilled artisans (goldsmiths, bead-makers).</li>
            <li>Bead-making factory discovered at <strong>Chanhudaro</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ══ DECLINE ══ -->
        <h2>📉 PART 5: Decline of the Harappan Civilisation</h2>
        <p>The civilisation declined around <strong>1900–1500 BCE</strong>. No single definitive cause is accepted;
            scholars propose several theories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aryan Invasion / Migration Theory:</strong> Proposed by Mortimer Wheeler — Aryans invaded and
                destroyed the cities. Evidence: Skeletal remains found at Mohenjo-daro (though now disputed). This
                theory is now largely rejected or downplayed.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Floods from the Indus River — Mohenjo-daro shows signs of repeated
                flooding. Tectonic activity may have altered river courses.</li>
            <li><strong>Drying of the Saraswati River:</strong> The mythical river Saraswati (identified with the
                Ghaggar-Hakra) may have dried up due to tectonic shifts, disrupting agriculture in eastern sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Change / Drought:</strong> Reduced monsoon rainfall leading to desertification
                (supported by environmental data).</li>
            <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Over-use of wood to fire bricks may have led to deforestation and
                ecological collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Epidemic Disease:</strong> Skeletal evidence of disease has been found.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="warn-box">
            <div class="box-title">⚠️ ICSE Exam Point</div>
            Most historians today accept that the decline was caused by a <strong>combination of factors</strong> —
            environmental, economic, and possibly demographic — and not a single dramatic event.

            <h2>📌 Chapter Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Harappan Civilisation (c. 3000–1500 BCE) was one of the world's four earliest civilisations
                    alongside Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China.</li>
                <li>It was known for remarkable urban planning — grid streets, the first drains, standardised bricks,
                    and the Great Bath.</li>
                <li>Trade was well-organised: internal trade with standardised weights; external trade with Mesopotamia
                    via Lothal's dockyard.</li>
                <li>Art included bronze casting, seals, terracotta figurines, and sophisticated jewellery.</li>
                <li>The script remains undeciphered. The civilisation's decline (c. 1900–1500 BCE) was likely due to a
                    combination of environmental and economic causes.</li>

            Chapter 5 (Detailed Master Notes)</p>

        <div class="rule-box">
            <p><strong>Chapter Overview</strong></p>
            <p>All living organisms require food for energy, growth, and repair. While animals must consume other
                organisms, green plants possess the unique ability to manufacture their own food. This process, powered
                by sunlight, is called <strong>Photosynthesis</strong>. In this chapter, we will explore how plants
                convert simple raw materials from the environment into complex organic food.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5.1 Nutrition in Organisms</h2>
        <p>Nutrition is the process by which living organisms obtain and utilize food. There are two primary modes of
            nutrition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Autotrophic Nutrition (Auto = self, trophon = nourishment):</strong> Organisms synthesize their
                own food from simple inorganic substances like carbon dioxide and water. Green plants are autotrophs
                (producers).</li>
            <li><strong>Heterotrophic Nutrition (Hetero = others):</strong> Organisms cannot prepare their own food and
                depend directly or indirectly on plants for nutrition. Animals, fungi, and humans are heterotrophs
                (consumers).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5.2 What is Photosynthesis?</h2>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <p><strong>Photosynthesis</strong> (Photo = light, Synthesis = putting together) is the biological process
                by which green plants containing chlorophyll synthesize simple sugars (glucose) from carbon dioxide and
                water, using the energy of sunlight. Oxygen gas is released as a byproduct.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The General Chemical Equation</h3>
        <div class="derivation-box">
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem;">
                $6CO_2 + 6H_2O \xrightarrow{\text{Sunlight}}_{\text{Chlorophyll}} C_6H_{12}O_6 (\text{Glucose}) + 6O_2
                \uparrow$
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; color: #555;">(Carbon Dioxide + Water $\rightarrow$ Glucose + Oxygen)</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5.3 Essential Requirements for Photosynthesis</h2>
        <p>For photosynthesis to occur, four essential factors must be present simultaneously:</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sunlight (Solar Energy):</strong> The ultimate source of energy. It is captured by the plant
                    leaves. The intensity of light directly affects the rate of photosynthesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Chlorophyll:</strong> The green pigment present in structures called
                    <strong>chloroplasts</strong> (mainly located in leaves). It acts as a solar panel, trapping light
                    energy and converting it into chemical energy. Leaves are often called the "food factories" of the
                    plant.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$):</strong> Obtained from the air. It enters the leaves through tiny
                    microscopic pores present on their surface called <strong>stomata</strong> (singular: stoma). Each
                    stoma is guarded by two kidney-shaped guard cells that open and close the pore.</li>
                <li><strong>Water ($H_2O$) and Minerals:</strong> Absorbed from the soil by the root hair system. The
                    water is transported upwards through the stem to the leaves by specific conductive tissues called
                    <strong>Xylem</strong> vessels.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Process of Photosynthesis">
            <p class="img-caption"><strong>AI Image Prompt:</strong> A vibrant, detailed educational diagram of a green
                plant showing the process of photosynthesis. Sun rays pointing to the green leaves, arrows showing
                Carbon Dioxide entering the leaf, Oxygen leaving the leaf, and roots drawing water from the soil. A
                magnifying glass callout showing a stoma on the leaf surface and chloroplasts inside a plant cell.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5.4 Site of Photosynthesis: The Leaf structure</h2>
        <p>Leaves are specially adapted to maximize photosynthesis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Broad Flat Surface (Lamina):</strong> Provides a large surface area to absorb maximum sunlight.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Thinness:</strong> Allows sunlight to penetrate easily and reach the inner cells, and allows
                rapid diffusion of gases ($CO_2$ in, $O_2$ out).</li>
            <li><strong>Stomata:</strong> Present mainly on the lower surface (underside) of the leaf to minimize water
                loss by transpiration, while allowing efficient gas exchange.</li>
            <li><strong>Veins (Vascular Bundles):</strong> Extensive network containing Xylem (brings water) and Phloem
                (transports manufactured food away).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5.5 Fate of the Manufactured Food</h2>
        <p>The immediate product of photosynthesis is a simple carbohydrate called <strong>Glucose</strong>. What
            happens to it?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Use:</strong> Some glucose is utilized immediately by the plant cells during
                respiration to produce energy for daily life activities (growth, repair).</li>
            <li><strong>Storage (Starch):</strong> Plants do not store food as glucose. Excess glucose is rapidly
                converted into an insoluble complex carbohydrate called <strong>Starch</strong>. This starch is stored
                temporarily in leaves or permanently in roots, stems, fruits, or tubers (like potatoes).</li>
            <li><strong>Transport (Phloem):</strong> The food must be transported to non-green parts of the plant
                (roots, stem, flowers). This transport of soluble food is called <strong>translocation</strong> and
                occurs through a vascular tissue called <strong>Phloem</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5.6 Significance of Photosynthesis</h2>
        <p>Photosynthesis is arguably the most important biological process on Earth:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Primary Source of Food:</strong> It provides food directly or indirectly for all living
                organisms. Herbivores eat plants, and carnivores eat herbivores. Without plants, the food chain would
                collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Release of Oxygen:</strong> It is the only natural process that constantly adds oxygen to the
                atmosphere, which is essential for the survival and respiration of all animals and humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintaining Carbon Dioxide Levels:</strong> By absorbing $CO_2$ during photosynthesis, plants
                help regulate the levels of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, thereby helping to control global
                warming.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="practice-box">
            <span class="practice-header">Practice Zone</span>
            <p class="practice-q">Q1. During photosynthesis, what energy conversion takes place?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Light energy (solar energy) is converted into chemical energy (stored in the
                bonds of glucose).</p>
            <br>
            <p class="practice-q">Q2. How would you test a leaf for the presence of starch?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The presence of starch in a leaf can be tested using the Iodine test. First, the
                leaf is boiled in water to kill cells and then in alcohol to remove the green chlorophyll pigment
                (decolorization). The pale leaf is washed in warm water to soften it. Finally, a few drops of Iodine
                solution are added. If starch is present, the leaf will turn a distinct blue-black color.</p>

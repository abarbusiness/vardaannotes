        <p class="header-subtitle">CBSE Class 8 Science • Chapter 17 • Detailed Master Notes</p>

        <div class="rule-box">
            <p><strong>Chapter Overview</strong></p>
            <p>When you look up at the night sky, you see thousands of twinkling stars and a glowing moon. In this
                chapter, we explore celestial objects like the moon, stars, planets, and the structure of our solar
                system.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <h2>17.1 Celestial Objects and The Moon</h2>
        <p>The stars, the planets, the moon and many other objects in the sky are called <strong>celestial
                objects</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The Moon</h3>
        <p>The moon is the brightest object in the night sky. It changes its shape day by day. The various shapes of the
            bright part of the moon as seen during a month are called <strong>phases of the moon</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Moon Day:</strong> The day on which the whole disc of the moon is visible.</li>
            <li><strong>New Moon Day:</strong> The day on which the moon is not visible at all.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="analysis-box">
            <h3>Why does the moon change its shape?</h3>
            <p>The moon does not produce its own light. We see the moon because the sunlight falling on it gets
                reflected towards us. We see only that part of the moon from which the light of the sun is reflected
                towards us. As the moon revolves around the earth, the illuminated portion visible to us changes.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The moon's surface is dusty and barren. It has many craters of different sizes and steep, high mountains. The
            moon has no atmosphere and no water, so life cannot exist there.</p>

        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Phases of the Moon">
            <p class="img-caption"><strong>AI Image Prompt:</strong> A diagram showing the phases of the moon. Earth is
                in the center, with sunlight coming from one side. The moon is shown at different positions in its orbit
                around Earth, indicating how the New Moon, Crescent, Half, Gibbous, and Full Moon phases appear to an
                observer on Earth.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <h2>17.2 The Stars and Constellations</h2>
        <p>Stars are celestial bodies that emit light of their own. The sun is also a star, but it appears much larger
            than other stars because it is near to us. Other stars are millions of times farther away than the sun.</p>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <p><strong>Light Year:</strong> The distances in space are so large that they are measured in a unit called
                <em>light year</em>. A light year is the distance travelled by light in one year. Light travels at a
                speed of about 300,000 km per second.</p>
            <p>Example: The sun is about 8 light minutes away from Earth. The next nearest star, <em>Alpha
                    Centauri</em>, is at a distance of about 4.3 light years.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The stars appear to move from east to west because the Earth rotates from west to east on its axis. However,
            there is one star, the <strong>Pole Star</strong> (Dhruv Tara), which appears stationary. This is because it
            is situated in the direction of the Earth's axis of rotation.</p>

        <div class="derivation-box">
            <h3>Constellations</h3>
            <p>The stars forming a group that has a recognizable shape is called a constellation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ursa Major (Great Bear / Saptarshi):</strong> It consists of seven prominent stars and looks
                    like a big dipper or a question mark. It helps in locating the Pole Star.</li>
                <li><strong>Orion (The Hunter):</strong> It has seven or eight bright stars. The three middle stars
                    represent the belt of the hunter. The star <em>Sirius</em>, the brightest star in the sky, is
                    located close to Orion.</li>
                <li><strong>Cassiopeia:</strong> A prominent constellation in the northern sky which looks like a
                    distorted letter W or M.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <h2>17.3 The Solar System</h2>
        <p>The sun and the celestial bodies which revolve around it form the solar system. It consists of large numbers
            of bodies such as planets, comets, asteroids and meteors.</p>

        <h3>The Sun</h3>
        <p>The sun is the nearest star to us. It is continuously emitting huge amounts of heat and light. The sun is the
            source of almost all energy on Earth.</p>

        <h3>The Planets</h3>
        <p>The planets look like stars, but they do not have light of their own. They merely reflect the sunlight that
            falls on them. The planets keep changing their positions with respect to the stars.</p>

        <p>A planet has a definite path in which it revolves around the sun. This path is called an
            <strong>orbit</strong>. The time taken by a planet to complete one revolution is called its <em>period of
                revolution</em>, which increases as the distance from the sun increases. A planet also spins on its own
            axis, which is called a <em>rotation</em>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asteroids:</strong> There is a large gap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This gap is
                occupied by a large number of small objects that revolve around the sun. These are called asteroids.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Comets:</strong> Comets revolve around the sun in highly elliptical orbits. A comet appears
                generally as a bright head with a long tail. The length of the tail grows in size as it approaches the
                sun. Halley's comet appears after nearly 76 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Meteors and Meteorites:</strong> At night, when the sky is clear, you might see bright streaks
                of light called shooting stars (though they are not stars). They are meteors. A meteor is a small object
                that enters Earth's atmosphere at high speed and burns out due to friction. Some meteors are large and
                pieces of them reach the Earth. These pieces are called meteorites.</li>

            <p class="practice-q">Q1. Why does Venus appear as the brightest planet in the sky?</p>
            <p><em>Ans:</em> Venus has a thick atmosphere that reflects most of the sunlight falling on it, making it
                highly luminous compared to other planets.</p>

        <h2>17.5 Artificial Satellites</h2>
        <p>Artificial satellites are man-made and revolve around the Earth much closer than the moon (Earth's natural
            satellite).</p>
        <p><em>Aryabhata</em> was the first Indian satellite. Other Indian satellites include INSAT, IRS, Kalpana-1, and
            EDUSAT. Artificial satellites are used for forecasting weather, transmitting television and radio signals,
            telecommunication, and remote sensing.</p>

        <h2>📖 PART 1: The Emergence of Nationalism</h2>
        <p>By the 1870s and 1880s, Indians began to realise that India was the people of India—all the people
            irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, or gender. They realised the British were exercising control
            over India's resources and lives, and unless this control was ended, India could not be for Indians.</p>

        <h3>Formation of the Indian National Congress (INC)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill
                controversy deepened this desire.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Indian National Congress</strong> was established when 72 delegates from all over the
                country met at Bombay in <strong>December 1885</strong>.</li>
            <li>Early leaders: Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerjee, Surendranath
                Banerji. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, played a part in bringing Indians from various regions
                together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🗣️ PART 2: A Nation in the Making (The Moderates)</h2>
        <div class="key-term">
            In its first twenty years (1885-1905), the Congress was "moderate" in its objectives and methods.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Political Demands:</strong> They wanted a greater voice for Indians in the government and
                administration. They demanded that the Legislative Councils be made more representative, and that
                Indians be placed in high positions in the government (holding Civil Service exams in India as well as
                London).</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Demands:</strong> They declared British rule had led to poverty and famines due to high
                land revenue and the drain of wealth to Britain. They demanded reduction of revenue, cut in military
                expenditure, and more funds for irrigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> They felt the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and
                if Indians put forward just demands through petitions, articles, and speeches, the British would accept
                them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🔥 PART 3: "Freedom is our Birthright" (The Radicals)</h2>
        <p>By the 1890s, many Indians began to raise questions about the political style of the Congress. In Bengal,
            Maharashtra, and Punjab, leaders like <strong>Bipin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Lala Lajpat Rai
                (Lal-Bal-Pal)</strong> emerged.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They strongly criticised the Moderates for their "politics of prayers" (petitions).</li>
            <li>They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the good intentions of the government.
                They must fight for <strong>Swaraj</strong> (self-rule).</li>
            <li>Tilak raised the famous slogan: <strong><em>"Freedom is my birthright and I shall have
                        it!"</em></strong></li>
        </ul>

                British-made foreign clothes in a bonfire. Dynamic and emotional.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-box">
            <div class="box-title">Viceroy Curzon's Move</div>
            In 1905, Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal (which was huge and included Bihar and parts of Orissa). The
            British pretext was "administrative convenience", but the real motive was to divide the Bengali politicians
            and split the Hindu and Muslim populations.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The partition infuriated people all over India. Both Moderates and Radicals opposed it. Huge public
                meetings and demonstrations were organised.</li>
            <li>The struggle that unfolded came to be known as the <strong>Swadeshi movement</strong>. It was strongest
                in Bengal but echoed elsewhere (known as Vandemataram Movement in deltaic Andhra).</li>
            <li><strong>Swadeshi Movement Methods:</strong> Mass mobilisation, boycott of British institutions and
                goods, and setting up of national education enterprises and Swadeshi industries. Radicals advocated
                revolutionary violence to overthrow British rule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Surat Split (1907) & The Muslim League (1906)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the <strong>All India Muslim League</strong> at Dacca in
                1906. They supported the partition of Bengal and desired separate electorates for Muslims.</li>
            <li>The Congress split in 1907 at Surat because the Moderates were opposed to the use of boycott and mass
                mobilisation, preferring constitutional methods. The two groups reunited in 1915.</li>
            <li>In 1916, the Congress and Muslim League signed the historic <strong>Lucknow Pact</strong>, agreeing to
                work together for representative government.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🚶‍♂️ PART 4: The Growth of Mass Nationalism (The Gandhi Era)</h2>
        <p>After 1919 (post WWI), the national movement became a mass movement involving peasants, tribals, students,
            and women.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Economic impact of WWI:</strong> Huge rise in defence expenditure led to increased taxes on
                individual incomes and business profits. Prices soared, causing great difficulty for common people.
                Villages were forced to supply soldiers (forced recruitment).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arrival of Mahatma Gandhi</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            Gandhi arrived in India from South Africa in <strong>1915</strong>. He was already a respected leader
            internationally known for his non-violent civil disobedience campaigns (Satyagraha) against racist
            restrictions.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>He spent his first year travelling throughout India, understanding the people. His earliest
                interventions were in <strong>Champaran (1917)</strong>, <strong>Kheda (1918)</strong>, and
                <strong>Ahmedabad (1918)</strong> where he led peaceful strikes for millworkers and peasants.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Rowlatt Satyagraha (1919) & Jallianwala Bagh</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1919, the British passed the Rowlatt Act which curbed fundamental rights like freedom of expression
                and strengthened police powers (allowing arrest without trial).</li>
            <li>Gandhi called for a nationwide Satyagraha against the Act on 6 April 1919 (observed as a day of
                humiliation and prayer with strikes).</li>
            <li><strong>Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (13 April 1919):</strong> General Dyer ordered troops to fire on a
                peaceful, unarmed gathering in Amritsar on Baisakhi day, killing hundreds. Rabindranath Tagore renounced
                his knighthood in protest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Khilafat Agitation and Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Khilafat Issue:</strong> In 1920, the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan
                (Khalifa). Indian Muslims were furious. Leaders Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali initiated a full-fledged
                Non-Cooperation movement with Gandhi's support to protest against the Punjab wrongs (Jallianwala) and
                the Khilafat wrong, and demand swaraj.</li>
            <li><strong>NCM Methods (1921-22):</strong> Thousands of students left government schools and colleges.
                Lawyers (Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das) gave up practices. British titles were surrendered. Legislatures were
                boycotted. Foreign cloth was burned in huge bonfires.</li>
            <li><strong>Chauri Chaura Incident (Feb 1922):</strong> A peaceful protest turned violent when a crowd set
                fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura (UP), killing 22 policemen. <em>Gandhi immediately called off
                    the Non-Cooperation Movement</em> as he was strictly against violence.</li>
        </ul>

                observed as Independence Day.</li>
            <li><strong>The Salt March (1930):</strong> Gandhi declared he would lead a march to break the salt law. The
                state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Gandhi argued that taxing salt (an essential
                item of food) was sinful.</li>
            <li>Gandhi and his followers marched over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of
                <strong>Dandi</strong>. On 6 April 1930, he broke the law by gathering natural salt and boiling
                seawater.
            </li>
            <li>This marked the beginning of the <strong>Civil Disobedience Movement</strong>. Peasants, tribals, and
                women participated in large numbers. The government responded with brutal crushing of peaceful
                satyagrahis.</li>

        <h2>✊ PART 6: Quit India and Later</h2>
        <div class="info-box">
            <div class="box-title">Do or Die (1942)</div>
            During World War II, Gandhi decided to initiate a new phase of movement against the British in the middle of
            the war. The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, <strong>"Do or
                Die"</strong> but non-violently.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The British arrested Gandhi and other leaders immediately. But the movement spread. It specially
                attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it.</li>
            <li>Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked. In many areas people set up their own
                governments. The rebellion brought the British Raj to its knees.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Towards Independence and Partition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>By the 1940s, the Muslim League (led by Jinnah) had moved a resolution demanding "Independent States"
                for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. They feared Muslims would always play
                second fiddle in any democratic structure.</li>
            <li>The failure of the Cabinet Mission (1946) to provide a united framework led the League to announce 16
                August 1946 as "Direct Action Day" to demand Pakistan. Riots broke out in Calcutta lasting several days,
                resulting in thousands of deaths. Mass violence spread to northern India.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Millions were forced to flee their homes. India was eventually partitioned. A
                new country, <strong>Pakistan</strong>, was born. Independence Day (15 August 1947) was thus a mix of
                joy and the pain of immense violence and division.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>📌 Chapter Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Growth of Nationalism:</strong> Oppressive laws (Arms Act, Vernacular Press Act) and Ilbert
                    Bill controversy led to the formation of the INC in 1885.</li>
                <li><strong>Moderates vs Radicals:</strong> Moderates (1885-1905) used petitions; Radicals (Lal-Bal-Pal)
                    demanded Swaraj and used boycotts, especially after the Partition of Bengal (1905) triggering the
                    Swadeshi Movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Gandhi Era:</strong> Arrived 1915. Used Satyagraha. Important movements: Rowlatt Satyagraha
                    (1919) followed by Jallianwala Bagh massacre; Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22) unifying
                    Hindus/Muslims over Khilafat (called off after Chauri Chaura).</li>
                <li><strong>Civil Disobedience:</strong> Following Purna Swaraj demand (1929), Gandhi broke the Salt Law
                    via the Dandi March (1930).</li>
                <li><strong>Final Push:</strong> Quit India movement (1942) gave the "Do or Die" slogan. Finally, due to
                    League's Two-Nation theory and communal riots, India gained independence in 1947 but suffered
                    Partition.</li>

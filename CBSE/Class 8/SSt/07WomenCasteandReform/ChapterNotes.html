        </div>

        <h2>📖 PART 1: The Condition of Women in the 19th Century</h2>
        <p>Two hundred years ago, the lives of Indian women were very different. Children were married off at an early
            age. Both Hindu and Muslim men could marry more than one wife. Women had virtually no rights to property,
            and education was mostly denied to them.</p>

        <h3>Sati</h3>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">

            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> Raja Rammohun Roy standing confidently in an early 19th-century Calcutta street,
                holding a scroll or petition, passionately debating orthodox leaders against the practice of Sati. The
                setting shows colonial India with a mix of Indian and British architecture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="key-term">
            In some parts of the country, widows were praised if they chose death by burning themselves on the funeral
            pyre of their husbands. Women who died in this manner, whether willingly or otherwise, were called
            <strong>"sati"</strong>, meaning virtuous women.
        </div>

        <h3>Caste System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Society was also strictly divided along caste lines. <strong>Brahmans</strong> and
                <strong>Kshatriyas</strong> considered themselves "upper castes".
            </li>
            <li>Others, like traders and moneylenders (often <strong>Vaishyas</strong>), were placed after them. Then
                came peasants and artisans such as weavers and potters (<strong>Shudras</strong>).</li>
            <li>At the lowest rung were those who cleaned cities or worked at jobs considered polluting. The upper
                castes treated these groups as <strong>"untouchable"</strong>. They were not allowed to enter temples,
                draw water from the wells, or bathe in common ponds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🤝 PART 2: Working Towards Change (Key Reformers)</h2>
        <p>From the early 19th century, debates and discussions about social customs began taking a new character,
            mainly due to the development of new forms of communication (books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets).</p>

        <h3>1. Raja Rammohun Roy (1772-1833)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>He founded a reform association known as the <strong>Brahmo Sabha</strong> (later Brahmo Samaj) in
                Calcutta.</li>
            <li>He spoke out against unjust practices, particularly <strong>Sati</strong>. He was well-versed in
                Sanskrit, Persian, and several other Indian and European languages.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> He tried to show through his writings that the practice of widow burning had
                no sanction in ancient texts. British officials, who were themselves criticizing Indian traditions,
                supported him.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> In <strong>1829, Sati was officially banned.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Used ancient texts to suggest that widows could remarry.</li>
            <li>His suggestions were adopted by British officials, and a law was passed in <strong>1856 permitting widow
                    remarriage</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Girls Begin Going to School</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Many reformers felt that education for girls was essential to improve their condition. Vidyasagar set up
                schools for girls in Calcutta. Many others were set up in Bombay.</li>
            <li>When the first schools opened in the mid-19th century, many people were <strong>afraid</strong>. They
                feared schools would take girls away from home, prevent them from doing domestic duties, and corrupt
                their morals by teaching them to read/write. Therefore, throughout the 19th century, most educated women
                were taught <em>at home</em> by liberal fathers or husbands.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Rashsundari Debi (secretly learned to read and write in the flickering light
                of candles at night).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Women Write about Women</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>From the 1880s, Indian women began to enter universities. Some trained to be doctors, others teachers.
                Many began to write and publish their critical views on the place of women in society.</li>
            <li><strong>Tarabai Shinde:</strong> Published a book, <em>Stripurushtulna</em> (A Comparison between Women
                and Men), criticizing the social differences between men and women.</li>
            <li><strong>Pandita Ramabai:</strong> A great scholar of Sanskrit, she felt Hinduism was oppressive towards
                women. She wrote a book about the miserable lives of upper-caste Hindu widows and founded a widows' home
                at Poona to provide shelter for women mistreated by husbands or relatives.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🚫 PART 3: The Movement Against Caste</h2>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">

                social reform and education.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Many reformers who fought for women also fought against the rigid caste system.</p>

        <h3>Paramhans Mandali (1840)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Founded in Bombay to work for the abolition of caste. Many of these reformers were derived from the
                upper castes. Often, in secret meetings, they would violate caste taboos on food and touch, attempting
                to rid their lives of prejudice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Jyotirao Phule (1827-1890)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the most vocal "low-caste" leaders. Born in 1827, he studied in schools set up by Christian
                missionaries.</li>
            <li>He set out to attack the Brahmans' claim that they were superior. Phule argued that the Aryans were
                foreigners who came from outside the subcontinent and defeated the true indigenous people. After
                establishing their dominance, they began considering the defeated population as low-caste. According to
                Phule, the upper castes had <em>no right</em> to their land and power.</li>
            <li>He proposed that Shudras and Ati Shudras (untouchables) should unite to challenge caste discrimination.
                He founded the <strong>Satyashodhak Samaj</strong> to propagate caste equality.</li>
            <li>In 1873, he wrote a famous book called <strong>Gulamgiri</strong> (Slavery). He dedicated this book to
                all those Americans who had fought to free slaves, thus establishing a link between the condition of the
                "lower" castes in India and the black slaves in America.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Born into a Mahar family (considered untouchable). As a child, he experienced prejudice
                everywhere—forced to sit outside the classroom, not allowed to drink water from vessels used by
                upper-caste kids.</li>
            <li>After returning from higher studies in the US in 1919, he wrote extensively about upper-caste power in
                society.</li>
            <li>In 1927, Ambedkar started a <strong>Temple Entry Movement</strong>, in which his Mahar caste followers
                participated. Brahman priests were outraged when the Dalits used water from the temple tank.</li>
            <li>His aim was to make everyone see the power of caste prejudices within society and fight for equal
                rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Born in a middle-class family, he became an ascetic and carefully studied Sanskrit scriptures. Later, he
                joined the Congress but left it in disgust when he found that at a feast organized by nationalists,
                seating arrangements followed caste distinctions.</li>
            <li>Convinced that untouchables had to fight for their dignity, Periyar founded the <strong>Self Respect
                    Movement</strong>.</li>
            <li>He argued that untouchables were the true upholders of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture which had
                been subjugated by Brahmans.</li>
        </ul>

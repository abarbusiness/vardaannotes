            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A vibrant illustration of 19th-century Indian tribal life in a lush forest. Some are

                are gathering fruits and mahua flowers in woven baskets. Rich, natural colors.</p>
        </div>
        <p>By the 19th century, tribal people in different parts of India were involved in a variety of activities to
            sustain themselves.</p>

        <h3>1. Some Were Jhum Cultivators</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Jhum Cultivation</strong> (Shifting Cultivation) was done on small patches of land, mostly in
            forests. The cultivators cut treetops to let sunlight in and burnt the vegetation to clear the land.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>They spread the ash (containing potash) to fertilise the soil.</li>
            <li>They broadcast (scattered) the seeds instead of ploughing the land.</li>
            <li>Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field, leaving the old field
                <em>fallow</em> for several years so soil could recover its fertility.
            </li>
            <li>Practiced mainly in the hilly and forested tracts of North-East and Central India.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Some Were Hunters and Gatherers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Many regions saw tribal groups living by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests
                as essential for survival.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> The Khonds of Orissa lived in collective hunts and divided the meat. They ate
                fruits/roots and used oil from <em>sal</em> and <em>mahua</em> seeds to cook.</li>
            <li>They sold forest produce (shrubs/herbs, sal leaves, flowers) in local markets to weavers and leather
                workers who needed them to dye clothes and leather.</li>
            <li>When forest supplies shrank, they sometimes had to wander in search of work as labourers, leading to
                exploitation by moneylenders and traders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Some Herded Animals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Many tribal groups were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the
                seasons.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> The <em>Van Gujjars</em> of Punjab hills and <em>Labadis</em> of Andhra
                Pradesh were cattle herders. The <em>Gaddis</em> of Kullu were shepherds. The <em>Bakarwals</em> of
                Kashmir reared goats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Some Took to Settled Cultivation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Even before the 19th century, many from within the tribal groups had begun settling down, ploughing the
                same field year after year instead of constantly moving.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> The <em>Mundas</em> of Chota Nagpur considered the land belonged to the clan
                as a whole, tracing descent to original settlers. Sometimes strong members became chiefs (and rented out
                land), while others remained followers.</li>
            <li>British officials saw these settled groups (like the Santhals and Gonds) as more <em>civilised</em> than
                the wild hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>⚔️ PART 2: How Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?</h2>

        <h3>1. What Happened to Tribal Chiefs?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Before British arrival, tribal chiefs were important people enjoying economic power and the right to
                administer their territories.</li>
            <li><strong>Under British rule:</strong> They lost much of their administrative power and were forced to
                follow laws made by British officials in India. They were allowed to keep their land titles but had to
                pay tribute to the British and "discipline" the tribe on their behalf. They lost the authority they
                earlier enjoyed among their people.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. What Happened to the Shifting Cultivators?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about. They wanted them to settle down and become
                peasant cultivators because settled peasants were easier to control and measured as a regular revenue
                source.</li>
            <li>The British introduced land settlements, measuring land, defining rights, and fixing revenue demands.
            </li>
            <li>The effort to settle Jhum cultivators was largely unsuccessful because water was scarce and soil was dry
                in those regions. Ploughs wouldn't work easily. Facing widespread protests, the British eventually had
                to allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Forest Laws and Their Impact</h3>
        <div class="info-box">
            <div class="box-title">Reserved Forests</div>
            The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some
            forests producing timber (like <em>sal</em> and <em>teak</em>) were classified as <strong>Reserved
                Forests</strong>.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>In Reserved Forests, people were <strong>not allowed</strong> to move freely, practise jhum cultivation,
                collect fruits, or hunt animals.</li>
            <li><strong>Resulting Problem:</strong> How would shifting cultivators survive? Many were forced to move
                away in search of work. But this created a problem for the British—where would they get labour to cut
                trees for railway sleepers?</li>
            <li><strong>The Solution (Forest Villages):</strong> The colonial officials decided they would give jhum
                cultivators small patches of land in the forests, on the condition that those who lived there would have
                to provide free labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests.</li>
            <li>Many tribal groups rebelled against these unjust laws leading to uprisings. Example: The revolt of
                Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. The Problem with Trade</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Dikus:</strong> The tribal term for outsiders (traders, moneylenders, and British officials) who
            came into the forest and caused misery.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>During the 19th century, traders and moneylenders came into the forests more often, wanting to buy
                forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages.</li>
            <li>Tribals found this initially confusing but later realized they were caught in a debt trap. Example:
                Santhals reared cocoons (silk) and were paid Rs 3-4 for a thousand cocoons. These were exported to
                Burdwan or Gaya and sold at five times the price. The middlemen made huge profits, but the growers
                earned next to nothing, leading them to view traders ("dikus") as their enemies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>👑 PART 3: Birsa Munda and the Vision of a Golden Age</h2>
        <div

            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A powerful and heroic portrait of Birsa Munda, the young tribal leader. He is
                wearing traditional Dhoti, standing bravely in the Chotanagpur forest, inspiring a crowd of Santhal and
                Munda followers around him who are holding white flags. Cinematic lighting.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Birsa was born in the mid-1870s into a family of Mundas, a tribal group in Chotanagpur. He grew up hearing
            tales of a <strong>Golden Age (Satyug)</strong> when Mundas were free from the oppression of dikus.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In 1895, Birsa started a movement, urging his followers to recover their glorious past by giving up
                liquor, cleaning their villages, stopping belief in witchcraft, and planting trees to restore their
                land.</li>
            <li>He turned against missionaries (who criticized Munda culture) and Hindu landlords/moneylenders who were
                taking over Munda lands and forcing them to work as bonded labourers.</li>
            <li>His vision was to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government to set up a
                <strong>Munda Raj</strong> with Birsa at its head. The followers attacked police stations, churches, and
                raided the property of moneylenders, flying the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> In 1895, he was arrested for two years for rioting. Though released in 1897, he
                toured villages gathering support. In 1900, Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why was the movement significant?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It forced the colonial government to introduce laws (Chotanagpur Tenancy Act, 1908) so that land of the
                tribals could not be easily taken over by <em>dikus</em>.</li>
            <li>It showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express
                their anger against colonial rule.</li>
        </ol>

            <h2>📌 Chapter Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tribal Lifestyles:</strong> Jhum (shifting) cultivators, hunter-gatherers (Khonds),
                    pastoralists (Van Gujjars), settled cultivators (Mundas/Santhals).</li>
                <li><strong>Colonial Impact:</strong> Tribal chiefs lost power. Jhum cultivators were forced to settle
                    for revenue purposes. Forest Laws restricted access to forests and created <em>Forest Villages</em>
                    for cheap labour.</li>
                <li><strong>Dikus (Outsiders):</strong> Traders and moneylenders who exploited the tribals through debt
                    traps (e.g., buying silk cocoons cheap and selling high).</li>
                <li><strong>Birsa Munda:</strong> Led a revolt in Chota Nagpur to establish a Munda Raj and drive out
                    the dikus. Promoted social reform among Mundas. Died in 1900, but movement led to laws protecting
                    tribal lands.</li>

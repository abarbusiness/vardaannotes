        <h2>📖 PART 1: How Important are Dates?</h2>
        <p>History is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past
            and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of
            "before" and "after".</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There was a time when history was synonymous with dates. Historians debated over dates on which rulers
                were crowned or battles were fought.</li>
            <li>However, history is not just about political events. We cannot fix a single date for processes like
                people starting to drink tea, or the development of the national movement. These things happened over a
                stretch of time.</li>
            <li>Dates are important as they act as <strong>milestones</strong>. They help us understand the sequence of
                events (chronology).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📅 PART 2: Which Dates?</h2>
        <div class="key-term">
            The dates we select become important because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our
            focus of study changes, a new set of dates will appear significant.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was
                important. Their history books began with the first Governor-General, <strong>Warren Hastings</strong>
                (1773), and ended with the last Viceroy, <strong>Lord Mountbatten</strong>.</li>
            <li>These books were packed with dates, battles, policies, and achievements of these men. They largely
                ignored what Indians were doing or experiencing during this time.</li>
        </ul>

                    IMAGE:</strong> A 19th-century vintage aesthetic illustration of a British historian (James Mill)
                sitting at a large wooden desk filled with old manuscripts and maps of India, writing 'A History of
                British India'. The scene should feel colonial and scholarly, with warm oil-lamp lighting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-box">
            <div class="box-title">James Mill and "A History of British India"</div>
            In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work,
            <em>A History of British India</em>.
        </div>
        <p>He divided Indian history into three periods:</p>
        <table class="styled-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Period</th>
                    <th>Basis / Mill's View</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>1. Hindu</strong></td>
                    <td>The ancient period ruled by Hindu kings. Mill thought this was a dark age of religious
                        intolerance, caste taboos, and superstitious practices.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>2. Muslim</strong></td>
                    <td>The medieval period ruled by Muslim emperors (Delhi Sultanate, Mughals). Again, viewed as an era
                        of despots and darkness.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>3. British</strong></td>
                    <td>The modern period. Mill felt British rule could civilise India by introducing European manners,
                        arts, institutions, and laws. He believed India was not capable of progress without British
                        help.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h3>Why is Mill's periodisation problematic?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is wrong to characterise an age ONLY through the religion of the rulers of the time. Many faiths
                existed simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Not all rulers in ancient India shared the same faith.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🔄 PART 4: Other Classifications of History</h2>
        <p>Indian historians usually divide Indian history into: <strong>Ancient, Medieval, and Modern.</strong></p>
        <div class="key-term">
            This division is borrowed from the West, where the "Modern" period meant the growth of reason, science,
            liberty, and equality. "Medieval" was a term used to describe a society where these modern features did not
            exist.
        </div>
        <p>Under British rule, Indians did not have equality, freedom, or liberty. Nor was it a period of economic
            growth for India. Therefore, many historians refer to this period not as "Modern", but as
            <strong>Colonial</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Colonisation:</strong> The process of subjugation of one country by another, leading to political,
            economic, social, and cultural changes.
        </div>

        <h2>📂 PART 5: How do we know about the Past? (Sources of History)</h2>
        <p>What sources do historians use in writing about the last 250 years of Indian history?</p>

        <h3>1. Administration produces records</h3>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="National Archives"
                style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A grand colonial-era record room filled with towering wooden bookshelves stacked
                completely with thousands of dusty ledger books, scrolls, and files. A British official is meticulously
                writing in a large ledger book. High detail, historical setting.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The British believed that the act of writing was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision,
                agreement, and investigation had to be clearly written up.</li>
            <li>They set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions (the village tahsildar's office,
                the collectorate, law courts).</li>
            <li>Specialised institutions like <strong>archives</strong> and <strong>museums</strong> were also
                established to preserve important records. E.g., The National Archives of India (established in the
                1920s in New Delhi).</li>
            <li>These records tell us what the British officials thought and what they wanted to preserve.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Surveys become important</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The British believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively
                administered.</li>
            <li>They carried out detailed surveys to map the entire country (revenue surveys, topographic surveys).</li>
            <li>From the end of the 19th century, <strong>Census</strong> operations were held every ten years. These
                recorded the number of people in all provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions, and
                occupation.</li>
            <li>Other surveys: Botanical, zoological, archaeological, anthropological, and forest surveys.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. What official records do NOT tell</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            Official records hide the feelings, struggles, and real experiences of the common people of India (tribals,
            peasants, workers). They only tell us what the officials thought.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>To understand the history of the ordinary people, historians have to look for other sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Other sources include:</strong> diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers,
                autobiographies of important personalities, popular booklets (sold in local bazaars), newspapers, and
                the writings of leaders, reformers, poets, and novelists.</li>
        </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Important as milestones, but history is about processes that stretch over
                    time.</li>
                <li><strong>Periodisation:</strong> James Mill (1817) divided Indian history into Hindu, Muslim, and
                    British periods, reflecting a biased colonial view. Modern historians use Ancient, Medieval, and
                    Modern/Colonial.</li>
                <li><strong>Colonisation:</strong> British subjugation causing deep socio-economic changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Official Records:</strong> British maintained meticulous written records, set up archives,
                    and conducted surveys (Topographic, Census) to aid administration.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations of Records:</strong> Official records reflect the ruler's perspective, hiding
                    the true plight of native Indians. Autobiographies, newspapers, and diaries help uncover the common
                    people's history.</li>

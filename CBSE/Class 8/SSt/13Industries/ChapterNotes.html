        <h2>📖 PART 1: What is an Industry?</h2>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Industry</strong> refers to an economic activity that is concerned with production of goods (e.g.,
            steel industry), extraction of minerals (e.g., coal mining), or the provision of services (e.g., tourism
            industry). Secondary activities (manufacturing) change raw materials into products of more value to people.
        </div>
        <p>As paper made from pulp and cloth made from cotton have had value added to them at each stage of the
            manufacturing process, the finished product has more value and utility than the raw material it is made
            from.</p>

        <h2>🏭 PART 2: Classification of Industries</h2>
        <div

        </div>
        <p>Industries can be classified on the basis of raw materials, size, and ownership.</p>

                        industries.</td>
                    <td>Iron and Steel industry. (Iron made from iron ore is used for heavy machinery, railway coaches).
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>Products from the sea and oceans.</td>
                    <td>Manufacturing fish oil, processing sea food.</td>

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>2. Based on Size</h3>
        <p>Size refers to the amount of capital invested, number of people employed, and the volume of production.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Small Scale Industries (Cottage/Household):</strong> Products are manufactured by hand by
                artisans. They use less amount of capital and technology. Examples: Basket weaving, pottery, and other
                handicrafts.</li>
            <li><strong>Large Scale Industries:</strong> Produce large volumes of products. Investment of capital is
                higher and the technology used is superior. Examples: Manufacture of automobiles and heavy machinery.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Based on Ownership</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Private Sector:</strong> Owned and operated by individuals or a group of individuals. (e.g.,
                Reliance, Tata Steel).</li>
            <li><strong>Public Sector:</strong> Owned and operated by the government. (e.g., Hindustan Aeronautics
                Limited, Steel Authority of India Limited - SAIL).</li>
            <li><strong>Joint Sector:</strong> Owned and operated jointly by the state and individuals (e.g., Maruti
                Udyog Limited).</li>
            <li><strong>Co-operative Sector:</strong> Owned and operated by the producers or suppliers of raw materials,
                workers or both. (e.g., Anand Milk Union Limited - AMUL, Sudha Dairy).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📍 PART 3: Factors Affecting Location of Industries</h2>
        <p>The factors affecting the location of industries are the availability of raw material, land, water, labour,
            power, capital, transport, and market.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Industries sit where some or all of these factors are easily available. Sometimes, the government
                provides incentives like subsidised power, lower transport cost, and other infrastructure so that
                industries may be located in backward areas facing low employment.</li>
            <li>Industrialisation often leads to the development and growth of towns and cities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>⚠️ PART 4: Industrial Disasters</h2>
        <div class="warn-box">
            <div class="box-title">The Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984)</div>
            One of the worst industrial disasters of all time occurred in Bhopal on 3 December 1984. Highly poisonous
            Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) gas along with Hydrogen Cyanide leaked from the Union Carbide pesticide factory.
            Thousands died, and many more suffered from blindness, impaired immune systems, and neurological disorders.
            This highlights the need for strict risk reduction measures around industrial areas.
        </div>

        <h2>⚙️ PART 5: Major Industries of the World</h2>
        <p>The world's major industries are the iron and steel industry, the textile industry, and the information
            technology (IT) industry. The first two are older, while IT is an emerging "sunrise" industry.</p>

        <h3>Iron and Steel Industry</h3>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">

                style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A dramatic scene inside a massive Iron and Steel factory. A gigantic blast furnace
                pouring bright glowing molten iron, while workers in safety gear oversee the heavy machinery. Emphasises
                the immense heat and scale of the "feeder" industry.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This is a <strong>feeder industry</strong> whose products are used as raw materials for other industries. The
            inputs for the industry include raw materials such as iron ore, coal, and limestone, along with labour,
            capital, site, and infrastructure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong> Iron ore is put in a blast furnace where it undergoes smelting. It is then
                refined into steel.</li>
            <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Steel is tough and can easily be shaped, cut, or made into wire. Almost
                everything we use—ships, trains, trucks, safety pins—is either made of iron or steel, or made with tools
                of iron or steel. Therefore, the iron and steel industry is often called the <em>backbone of modern
                    industry</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Major Centers:</strong> Germany, USA, China, Japan, Russia. Major centers in India include
                Bhilai, Durgapur, Burnpur, Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bokaro (primarily in the Chota Nagpur plateau region
                due to rich mineral resources). TISCO (Tata Iron and Steel Company) in Jamshedpur was the pioneer in
                India (started in 1907).</li>
            <li><strong>Pittsburgh:</strong> The steel city of the USA. It enjoys locational advantages as raw material
                (coal) is available locally, while iron ore comes from the iron mines at Minnesota (via Great Lakes
                waterway).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cotton Textile Industry</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The term ‘textile’ is derived from the Latin word <em>texere</em> which means to weave. Natural fibres
                (wool, silk, cotton, jute, flax) or man-made fibres (nylon, polyester, acrylic, rayon) are woven into
                cloth.</li>
            <li><strong>Early History:</strong> Initially, textiles were a hand-spinning industry (charkha and looms).
                With the industrial revolution, power looms were introduced in Britain and then other parts of the
                world. Huge production centres emerged in India, China, Japan, and the USA.</li>
            <li><strong>Ahmedabad (India):</strong> Known as the "Manchester of India". Located on the banks of
                Sabarmati river. Extremely favourable location due to proximity to the cotton-growing area of
                Gujarat/Maharashtra, ideal humid climate for spinning, and skilled labour. (Lately declining due to
                outdated machinery).</li>
            <li><strong>Osaka (Japan):</strong> The "Manchester of Japan". Entirely dependent on imported raw materials.
                The humid climate is well suited for spinning. Finished products are mostly exported.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>📌 Chapter Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Industry classification:</strong> By Resource (Agro, Mineral, Marine, Forest), Size
                    (Small-scale cottage vs Large-scale), and Ownership (Private, Public, Joint, Co-operative).</li>
                <li><strong>Location Factors:</strong> Availability of raw materials, water, labour, transport, capital,
                    power, and market determine where an industry is situated.</li>
                <li><strong>Bhopal Gas Tragedy:</strong> Underscores the critical importance of safety protocols in
                    industrial clusters.</li>
                <li><strong>Iron & Steel (Feeder Industry):</strong> Backbone of modern industry. Inputs are coal,
                    limestone, iron ore -> Smelted in a blast furnace. <em>Jamshedpur/TISCO</em> (India) and
                    <em>Pittsburgh</em> (USA) are prime examples.</li>
                <li><strong>Cotton Textile Industry:</strong> One of the oldest. <em>Ahmedabad</em> is the Manchester of
                    India due to raw cotton proximity, while <em>Osaka</em> is the Manchester of Japan relying fully on
                    imports.</li>

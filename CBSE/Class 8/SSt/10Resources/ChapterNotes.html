            In the NCERT Geography textbook, this is "Chapter 1: Resources". However, in our SST sequence, it is listed
            as Chapter 10.
        </div>

        <h2>📖 PART 1: What is a Resource?</h2>
        <div class="key-term">
            Anything that can be used to satisfy a human need is a <strong>Resource</strong>. For example, the water you
            drink, the electricity in your house, the textbook you use, and the vehicle you travel in.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Utility or Usability:</strong> This is what makes an object or substance a resource. If
                something is useful, it is a resource.</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> All resources have some value. Value means <em>worth</em>. Some resources have
                economic value (like metals, which can be bought and sold), while others do not (like a beautiful
                landscape or clean air), but both are important and satisfy human needs.</li>
            <li>Time and technology are two important factors that can change substances into resources. (For example,
                earlier waterfalls were not a resource. With the invention of hydroelectric technology, falling water
                became a huge resource for electricity).</li>
        </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A split-screen illustration showing different types of resources. On the left, lush
                natural resources (a flowing river, dense forest, shining sun). On the right, human-made resources (a
                modern bridge, solar panels, and a smart city skyline). Highly visual and educational.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Resources are generally classified into three types: Natural, Human-made, and Human.</p>

        <h3>1. Natural Resources</h3>
        <p>Resources that are drawn from Nature and used without much modification are called Natural Resources. The air
            we breathe, the water in our rivers, soils, minerals are all natural resources.</p>
        <p>Natural resources are broadly grouped into two categories based on their availability:</p>
        <table class="styled-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Type</th>
                    <th>Definition</th>
                    <th>Examples</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Renewable Resources</strong></td>
                    <td>Those which get renewed or replenished quickly. Some are limitless and not affected by human
                        activities. However, careless use of certain renewable resources like water, soil and forest can
                        affect their stock.</td>
                    <td>Solar energy, wind energy. (Water seems unlimited but shortages and drying up is a major
                        problem).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Non-Renewable Resources</strong></td>
                    <td>Those which have a limited stock. Once the stocks are exhausted it may take thousands of years
                        to be renewed or replenished. Since this period is much more than human life spans, they are
                        considered non-renewable.</td>
                    <td>Coal, petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, copper.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The distribution of natural resources depends on physical factors like terrain, climate, and altitude. The
            distribution is unequal because these factors differ so much over the Earth.</p>

        <h3>2. Human-Made Resources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes, natural substances become resources ONLY when their original form has been changed. Iron ore
                was not a resource until people learnt to extract iron from it.</li>
            <li>People use natural resources to make buildings, bridges, roads, machinery, and vehicles, which are known
                as <strong>human-made resources</strong>.</li>
            <li>Technology is also a human-made resource.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Human Resources</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Human Resource</strong> refers to the number (quantity) and abilities (mental and physical) of the
            people.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>People can make the best use of nature to create more resources when they have the knowledge, skill, and
                the technology to do so. That is why <strong>human beings are a special resource</strong>.</li>
            <li>Education and health help in making people a valuable resource.</li>
            <li>Improving the quality of people’s skills so that they are able to create more resources is known as
                <strong>Human Resource Development</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div

        <div class="key-term">
            Using resources carefully and giving them time to get renewed is called <strong>Resource
                Conservation</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="key-term">
            Balancing the need to use resources and also conserving them for the future is called <strong>Sustainable
                Development</strong>.
        </div>

        <h3>How to Conserve Resources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are many ways of conserving resources. Each person can contribute by:</li>
            <li><strong>Reducing</strong> consumption (don't waste water or electricity).</li>
            <li><strong>Recycling</strong> products (recycling paper saves trees).</li>
            <li><strong>Reusing</strong> things (using cloth bags instead of disposable plastic bags).</li>
            <li>Ultimately it makes a difference because all our lives are linked. If we use resources recklessly, the
                Earth will become uninhabitable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Principles of Sustainable Development</h3>
        <p>It is our duty to ensure that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>All uses of renewable resources are sustainable.</li>
            <li>The diversity of life on the earth is conserved.</li>
            <li>The damage to natural environmental system is minimised.</li>
            <li>Respect and care for all forms of life.</li>
            <li>Improve the quality of human life.</li>
            <li>Conserve the earth’s vitality and diversity.</li>
            <li>Enable communities to care for their own environment.</li>
        </ol>

                <li><strong>Natural Resources:</strong> Gifts of nature. <em>Renewable</em> (solar, wind, water)
                    replenish quickly; <em>Non-renewable</em> (coal, petroleum) have limited stock and take millennia to

                    machinery).</li>
                <li><strong>Human Resources:</strong> People are the ultimate resource. Education and health build human

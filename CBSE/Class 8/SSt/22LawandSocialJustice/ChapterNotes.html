        <h2>🏭 PART 1: The Need for Laws in the Market</h2>
        <p>To protect people from exploitation in the market, the government makes certain laws. These laws try to
            ensure that the unfair practices are kept at a minimum.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exploitation of Workers:</strong> Private companies, contractors, and businesspersons normally
                want to make as much profit as possible. In the drive for profits, they might deny workers their rights
                and not pay them wages. In the eyes of the law, it is illegal or wrong to deny workers their wages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Minimum Wages Act</h3>
        <div

        </div>
        <div class="key-term">
            The government has created a <strong>Minimum Wages Law</strong> which specifies that wages should not be
            below a certain minimum amount. This amount is revised every few years. This law ensures that workers are
            not underpaid or paid next to nothing because they are poor and easily exploitable.
        </div>

        <h3>Other Important Laws</h3>
        <table class="styled-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Purpose of Law</th>
                    <th>Why is it necessary?</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Safety Standards at Workplaces</strong></td>
                    <td>To ensure that alarm systems, emergency exits, and proper gear exist so that factory
                        fires/accidents do not result in worker deaths.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Child Labour (Prohibition) Act</strong></td>
                    <td>No child below the age of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory, mine, or hazardous
                        employment. Helps children attend school instead.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Quality Standards for Consumers</strong></td>
                    <td>Ensures that goods like electrical appliances and food do not cause harm. If a wire is of poor
                        quality, it might cause a deadly shock.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>However, merely making laws is not enough. The government must <strong>enforce</strong> the laws. Enforcement
            becomes even more important when the law seeks to protect the weak from the strong.</p>

        <h2>☠️ PART 2: The Bhopal Gas Tragedy</h2>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Bhopal Gas Tragedy Protest"
                style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A solemn illustration of the aftermath of the Bhopal Gas factory. In the foreground,
                affected citizens (some wearing masks) hold banners demanding "Justice for Bhopal" and "Punish Union
                Carbide". Emphasises the devastating effect of bypassing safety laws.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The world’s worst industrial tragedy took place in Bhopal forty years ago. <strong>Union Carbide
                (UC)</strong>, an American company, had a pesticide factory in Bhopal. At midnight on 2 December 1984,
            the highly poisonous <em>Methyl Isocyanate (MIC)</em> gas started leaking from this UC plant.</p>

        <h3>Why did it happen and what was the government doing?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Over 8,000 people died within days, and hundreds of thousands were maimed with respiratory problems, eye
                abnormalities, and severe health issues affecting even future generations.</li>
            <li><strong>Why Bhopal?</strong> Foreign companies come to India for cheap labour. Wages that companies pay
                to workers here are much lower than what they pay to workers in the US. By skipping on safety measures
                (defective alarms, fewer training days), companies cut costs and maximize profits.</li>
            <li><strong>Enforcement Failure:</strong> The safety laws in India at the time were weak. Furthermore, even
                these weak laws were not enforced by the government. Government inspectors allowed the UC factory to
                come up in a heavily populated area without checking the immense hazard risk.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🌍 PART 3: New Laws to Protect the Environment</h2>
        <p>Before the Bhopal tragedy, environmental protection in India was very weak. Industries were allowed to
            release toxic gases and chemical waste into the air and rivers without any restriction.</p>
        <div class="key-term">
            In response to this, the Indian government introduced new laws on the environment, stating that the
            <strong>polluter must be held accountable</strong>. The Supreme Court ruled that the Right to Life (Article
            21) includes the right to the enjoyment of <strong>pollution-free water and air</strong>.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Courts have directed a number of industries closing down or moving out of residential areas (like
                polluting factories around the Taj Mahal in Agra or in Delhi).</li>
            <li>A significant issue now is that while factories are shut to save the environment, factory workers
                instantly lose their livelihoods, leading to new waves of poverty. The path to social justice requires
                balance.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="summary-box">
            <h2>📌 Chapter Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> In the pursuit of pure profit, private entities often mercilessly
                    exploit workers and consumers through low wages and unsafe products.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum Wages Act:</strong> A protective law ensuring that a poor worker's desperation is
                    not exploited by paying them starvation wages.</li>
                <li><strong>Importance of Enforcement:</strong> Laws are useless if not strictly enforced. The
                    government's failure to enforce basic workplace safety laws allowed reckless foreign companies to
                    operate dangerously.</li>
                <li><strong>Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984):</strong> The ultimate failure of safety laws and enforcement,
                    leading to the massive toxic MIC gas leak by Union Carbide that killed and ruined thousands of
                    lives.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment & Article 21:</strong> The tragedy spurred new environmental laws in India. The
                    Supreme Court has unequivocally declared that breathing clean air and drinking clean water is a
                    Fundamental Right guaranteed to every citizen.</li>

            <div class="chapter-subtitle">The Company Becomes Diwan | Revenue Settlements | Indigo Cultivation</div>
        </div>

        <h2>📖 PART 1: The Company Becomes the Diwan</h2>
        <p>On <strong>12 August 1765</strong>, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of
            Bengal. As Diwan, the Company became the <strong>chief financial administrator</strong> of the territory
            under its control.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources safely.</li>
            <li>Before 1865, the Company purchased goods in India by importing <strong>gold and silver</strong> from
                Britain. After gaining the Diwani, the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods
                for export (no more gold imports).</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Ruin of Bengal:</strong> Artisans deserted villages because they were forced to sell
                goods at low prices. Peasants couldn't pay dues. Famine in 1770 killed 10 million people in Bengal
                (one-third of the population perished).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>💰 PART 2: The Need to Improve Agriculture (Revenue Systems)</h2>
        <p>If the economy was in ruins, the Company could not be certain of its revenue income. So, they introduced new
            land revenue systems to ensure a regular flow of income.</p>

        <h3>1. The Permanent Settlement (1793)</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            Introduced by <strong>Lord Cornwallis</strong> in Bengal and Bihar. Under this system, the rajas and
            taluqdars were recognized as <strong>zamindars</strong>. They were given the task of collecting rent from
            peasants and paying revenue to the Company.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The amount to be paid was fixed permanently (it was not to be increased ever in the future).</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The Company thought this would guarantee regular income, and since the revenue
                demand wouldn't increase, the zamindar would invest to improve the land to earn extra profit.</li>
            <li><strong>Problems:</strong> The revenue fixed was ridiculously high. If a zamindar failed to pay, his
                zamindari was auctioned off. Also, the zamindars did NOT invest in improving the land. Later, as
                cultivation expanded, zamindar income grew, but not the Company's. For the cultivator, the system was
                extremely oppressive—rent was high, and if they couldn't pay, they were evicted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. The Mahalwari Settlement (1822)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>By the early 19th century, Company officials felt the revenue system had to change—they needed
                <em>more</em> money.
            </li>
            <li>In the North Western Provinces of Bengal Presidency, an Englishman named <strong>Holt Mackenzie</strong>
                devised a new system.</li>
            <li>He felt the village was a crucial social institution. Collectors went from village to village to inspect
                the land, measuring fields, and recording rights of different groups.</li>
            <li>The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each
                village (<strong>mahal</strong>) had to pay.</li>
            <li>This demand was to be <strong>revised periodically</strong> (not permanently fixed). The charge of
                collecting the revenue was given to the <strong>village headman</strong>, rather than the zamindar.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. The Munro System / Ryotwari Settlement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In the southern territories, there were no traditional zamindars. So a system was devised by Captain
                Alexander Read and <strong>Thomas Munro</strong>.</li>
            <li>The settlement had to be made directly with the cultivators (<strong>ryots</strong>) who had tilled the
                land for generations. Their fields were carefully surveyed before the revenue assessment was made.</li>
            <li><strong>Result of all systems:</strong> Driven by the desire to increase income, revenue officials fixed
                the revenue demand too high. Peasants could not pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became
                deserted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🌿 PART 3: Crops for Europe</h2>
        <div

                horseback is supervising them. The scene captures the toil and rural landscape.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The British also realised that the countryside could not only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops
            that Europe required. By the late 18th century, the Company was expanding the cultivation of <strong>opium
                and indigo</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They also forced cultivators in various parts to produce other crops: Jute in Bengal, Tea in Assam,
                Sugarcane in UP, Wheat in Punjab, Cotton in Maharashtra/Punjab, Rice in Madras.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why the Demand for Indian Indigo?</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Indigo</strong> is a plant that produces a rich blue colour (dye) used by cloth manufacturers
            globally. It normally grows primarily in the tropics.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>By the 13th century, Indian indigo was being used in Italy, France, and Britain. Since only small
                amounts reached Europe and the price was very high, European dyers had to depend on another plant called
                <strong>woad</strong> to make violet/blue dyes. Woad produced a pale, dull blue, while indigo produced a
                rich blue.
            </li>
            <li>Cloth manufacturers persuaded European governments to relax the ban on indigo imports.</li>
            <li>But between 1783 and 1789, the production of indigo in the world fell by half. So, Britain turned to
                India for its indigo needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🚜 PART 4: How was Indigo Cultivated in India?</h2>

        <h3>1. The Nij System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In this system, the planter produced indigo on lands that he <strong>directly controlled</strong>
                (bought or rented). He hired forced labourers (coolies) to work it.</li>
            <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Indigo could only be cultivated on fertile lands, which were already
                densely populated. It required large areas in compact blocks to operate profitably. It required many
                ploughs and bullocks (1 bigha needed 2 ploughs) which were difficult to buy/maintain and busy with rice
                cultivation exactly when indigo needed them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. The Ryoti System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Under this system, the planters <strong>forced the ryots</strong> to sign a contract (<em>satta</em>) or
                an agreement. Those who signed got cash advances from planters at low interest rates.</li>
            <li><strong>The Trap:</strong> The loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25% of his
                land. The planter provided the seed and drill; the ryot cultivated, weeded, and harvested. When the crop
                was delivered to the planter, the price paid was incredibly low. A new loan was immediately given,
                starting an endless cycle of debt.</li>
            <li>Indigo also exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest, the land could not be sown with rice.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <div class="box-title">The Indigo Revolt (March 1859)</div>
            Thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo, refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked
            indigo factories with swords, spears, bows, and arrows. Social boycott of planters' agents
            (<em>gomasthas</em>) occurred.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why did they rebel?</strong> The system was intensely oppressive. They got support from the
                local zamindars and village headmen who were angry at the increasing power of the planters.</li>
            <li>In 1859, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region. The magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating
                ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts. Word spread that Queen Victoria had declared
                indigo didn't need to be sown.</li>
            <li>Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military and set up the <strong>Indigo
                    Commission</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>The Result:</strong> The Commission found the planters guilty of using coercive methods. It
                declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. They were told to fulfill existing
                contracts but could refuse to produce indigo in the future.</li>
            <li>Indigo production collapsed in Bengal. Planters shifted their operation to Bihar (Champaran), where
                Gandhi would later lead a movement against them in 1917.</li>

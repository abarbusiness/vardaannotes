            <div class="chapter-subtitle">Causes of the Revolt | The Mutiny | The Aftermath</div>
        </div>

        <h2>📖 PART 1: Causes of the Revolt of 1857</h2>
        <p>Policies of the East India Company affected different people — kings, queens, peasants, landlords, tribals,
            and soldiers — in different ways. By the mid-19th century, anger had built up to a boiling point.</p>

        <h3>1. Nawabs Lose Their Power (Political Causes)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since the mid-18th century, Nawabs and Rajas had seen their power erode. Residents had been stationed in
                their courts, freedom of rulers reduced, and armed forces disbanded. Their revenues and territories were
                taken away.</li>
            <li><strong>Rani Lakshmibai</strong> of Jhansi wanted the Company to recognize her adopted son as heir to
                the kingdom after the death of her husband (denied due to Doctrine of Lapse). <strong>Nana
                    Saheb</strong> (adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao II) pleaded for his father's pension to be paid to
                him (also denied).</li>
            <li><strong>Awadh Annexation (1856):</strong> Dalhousie annexed it citing "misgovernment." This deeply
                angered the sepoys, as many of them came from Awadh.</li>
            <li>The Company even planned to end the Mughal dynasty. The name of the Mughal king was removed from coins.
                In 1856, Governor-General Canning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar would be the last Mughal king, and his
                descendants would just be called "princes".</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. The Peasants and the Sepoys (Economic & Military Causes)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peasants and Zamindars:</strong> They resented the high taxes and rigid methods of revenue
                collection (like the Permanent Settlement). Many lost the lands they had tilled for generations to
                moneylenders.</li>
            <li><strong>Indian Sepoys:</strong> They were unhappy about their pay, allowances, and conditions of
                service. Some new rules violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs.</li>
            <li><strong>The Crossing of the Sea:</strong> In 1824, sepoys were ordered to cross the sea to Burma to
                fight for the Company. High-caste Hindus believed crossing the sea meant losing their religion and caste
                (an act called <em>Kala Pani</em>). They refused, and the result was severe punishment. In 1856, the
                Company passed a new law stating every new recruit must agree to serve overseas if required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Responses to Reforms (Social & Religious Causes)</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            The British believed Indian society had to be reformed. They tried to stop practices they considered
            backward, passing laws against **sati** (1829) and encouraging widow remarriage.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>English-language education was heavily promoted.</li>
            <li>In 1850, a new law made conversion to Christianity easier: it allowed Indian Christians to inherit the
                property of their ancestors.</li>
            <li>Many Indians felt that the British were actively trying to destroy their religion, their social customs,
                and their traditional way of life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🔥 PART 2: A Mutiny Becomes a Popular Rebellion</h2>
        <p>In May 1857, massive rebellion broke out, starting as a mutiny of sepoys and evolving into the biggest armed
            resistance to colonialism.</p>

        <h3>From Meerut to Delhi (The Immediate Cause)</h3>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">

            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR

                and rebellious in the Barrackpore cantonment, holding his Enfield rifle. Intense, dramatic historical
                scene signaling the start of the Indian Mutiny.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-box">
            <div class="box-title">The Enfield Rifle Cartridges</div>
            Rumours spread that the cartridges of the new Enfield rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs.
            Before loading, sepoys had to bite off the end of the cartridge. This outraged both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>On 29 March 1857, a young soldier, <strong>Mangal Pandey</strong>, was hanged to death for attacking his
                officers in Barrackpore.</li>
            <li>On 9 May 1857, 85 sepoys in Meerut refused to do army drill using the new cartridges and were sentenced
                to 10 years in jail.</li>
            <li>On 10 May, other soldiers released the imprisoned sepoys, killed British officers, set fire to
                buildings, and marched to Delhi.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Rebel Leadership</h3>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Rani Lakshmibai" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">

                    IMAGE:</strong> Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi riding a majestic white horse into battle against the
                British forces. She is dressed in armor and fine Indian royal clothes, wielding a sword, with her
                adopted son tied to her back. Highly detailed and inspiring.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The sepoys reached the Red Fort and proclaimed the aging Mughal emperor <strong>Bahadur Shah
                    Zafar</strong> as their leader. He wrote letters to all chiefs and rulers in India, urging them to
                form a confederacy to fight the British.</li>
            <li>Local leaders emerged at key centres:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Delhi:</strong> Bakht Khan</li>
                    <li><strong>Kanpur:</strong> Nana Saheb</li>
                    <li><strong>Lucknow:</strong> Begum Hazrat Mahal, her son Birjis Qadr, and Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Jhansi:</strong> Rani Lakshmibai (joined by Tantia Tope)</li>
                    <li><strong>Bihar (Arrah):</strong> Kunwar Singh (an old zamindar)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>⚔️ PART 3: The Company Fights Back</h2>
        <p>The British decided to repress the revolt with all their might. They passed new laws granting sweeping powers
            to convict rebels and moved forces in from England and other presidencies (like Punjab and Gurkhas who
            stayed loyal).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delhi</strong> was recaptured in September 1857. Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court,
                sentenced to life imprisonment, and blinded. His sons were shot before his eyes. He and his wife Begum
                Zinat Mahal were exiled to Rangoon (Burma) where he died in 1862.</li>
            <li><strong>Lucknow</strong> was taken in March 1858.</li>
            <li><strong>Rani Lakshmibai</strong> was defeated and killed in June 1858 fighting fiercely.</li>
            <li><strong>Tantia Tope</strong> escaped to the jungles of central India and fought a guerrilla war but was
                captured, tried, and killed in April 1859.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📜 PART 4: The Aftermath of the Revolt</h2>
        <p>By the end of 1859, the British had regained control of the country. They realized they could no longer rule
            India with the same policies as before. They initiated huge changes:</p>

        <h2>📖 PART 1: A New and Divided Nation</h2>
        <p>When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of massive challenges.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Partition/Refugees:</strong> As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the
                country from what was now Pakistan. Finding them homes and jobs was an immediate problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Princely States:</strong> There were almost 500 princely states ruled by maharajas or nawabs.
                Each had to be persuaded to join the new nation. <strong>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</strong> played a
                heroic role in this integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> The vast majority of Indians lived in villages. Farmers depended on the
                monsoon. Factory workers lived in crowded slums. Providing employment and increasing
                agricultural/industrial production was urgent.</li>
            <li><strong>Unity in Diversity:</strong> India's population in 1947 was almost 345 million. It was deeply
                divided by high and low castes, majority Hindu vs minority religions, multiple languages, and diverse
                customs. The challenge was to forge a united nation state out of this diversity.</li>
        </ul>

            Between December 1946 and November 1949, around 300 Indians met in New Delhi to draft the Constitution of
            India. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee. The Constitution was adopted on 26 Nov
            1949 and came into effect on <strong>26 January 1950</strong>.

                            vote</strong> in state and national elections. This was a massive, revolutionary step. Other
                        countries granted this over stages (men first, women later, after struggles). India gave it to
                        everyone at once.</td>

                        government jobs were <strong>reserved</strong> for members of the lowest castes (Scheduled
                        Castes) and Scheduled Tribes (Adivasis), who had been deprived of education and healthcare for
                        millennia.</td>
                </tr>

        <h3>Debate Over Language</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There was a fierce debate over which language should be the language of India. Many members wanted Hindi
                to replace English entirely.</li>
            <li>Non-Hindi speakers strongly objected. T.T. Krishnamachari from the South warned that forcing Hindi would
                push people in the South away.</li>
            <li><strong>Compromise:</strong> Hindi would be the "official language" of India, but English would continue
                to be used in the courts, the services, and communications between states.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🗣️ PART 3: How Were States to be Formed?</h2>
        <div class="key-term">
            In the 1920s, the Indian National Congress promised that after independence, each major linguistic group
            would have its own province. However, after the trauma of Partition (which was based on religion), Prime
            Minister Nehru and Deputy PM Vallabhbhai Patel were against creating linguistic (language-based) states,
            fearing it would divide the country further.
        </div>

        <h3>The Struggle for Andhra</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The decision not to form linguistic states caused deep disappointment, especially among Kannada,
                Malayalam, and Marathi speakers. The strongest protests came from the Telugu-speaking districts of the
                Madras Presidency.</li>
            <li>In October 1952, a veteran Gandhian, <strong>Potti Sriramulu</strong>, went on a fast-unto-death
                demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu speakers.</li>
            <li>His fast led to massive hartals/strikes. On 15 December 1952, after 58 days, he died. This resulted in
                widespread violence and chaos.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Realising they could not manage the chaos, the government gave in. The new
                state of <strong>Andhra</strong> came into being on 1 October 1953 (the first linguistic state in
                India).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The States Reorganisation Commission (1956)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>After Andhra, other linguistic groups demanded their own states too. The government set up the States
                Reorganisation Commission.</li>
            <li>In 1956, it recommended redrawing boundaries to form compact provinces of Assamese, Bengali, Oriya,
                Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, and Telugu speakers.</li>
            <li>Later changes: Bombay was divided into Maharashtra and Gujarat in 1960. In 1966, Punjab was divided into
                Punjab (Punjabi speakers) and Haryana (Haryanvi/Hindi speakers).</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <p>Lifting India and Indians out of poverty, and building a modern technical and industrial base were among the
            major objectives of the new nation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1950, the government set up a <strong>Planning Commission</strong> to design and execute suitable
                policies for economic development.</li>
            <li>India adopted a <strong>"mixed economy"</strong> model: both the State (government) and private sectors
                would play important and complementary roles in increasing production and generating jobs.</li>
            <li><strong>The First Five Year Plan (1951)</strong> focused heavily on agriculture and irrigation (building
                dams like Bhakra Nangal).</li>
            <li><strong>The Second Five Year Plan (1956)</strong> focused strongly on the development of <strong>heavy
                    industries</strong> such as steel (Bhilai, Rourkela, Durgapur) and the building of large dams. This
                approach was driven by Nehru's vision of a modern, industrialised India.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="warn-box">
            <div class="box-title">Criticism of the Second Plan</div>
            Some felt it put too much emphasis on heavy industry at the expense of agriculture and primary education.
            Others felt it didn't pay enough attention to the environmental impact of such industrial growth (as warned
            by Mira Behn).
        </div>

        <h2>🌐 PART 5: The Nation, Sixty Years On</h2>
        <p>Is India still united? Yes. Despite predictions by early critics that it would break up into many linguistic
            nations or succumb to military rule, it remains a robust, united democracy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Successes:</strong> Frequent free elections, independent judiciary, a relatively free press, and
                the fact that people speaking different languages and practicing different faiths still live together as
                one nation.</li>
            <li><strong>Failures/Challenges:</strong> Deep divisions persist. Despite Constitutional guarantees, the
                "untouchables" (Dalits) face violence and discrimination in many parts. Religious clashes still occur.
                The economic gap has widened—some Indians live in luxury, while others scrounge in slums and send their
                children to work instead of school.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>📌 Chapter Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Challenges (1947):</strong> Integrating 500+ princely states, managing 8 million
                    refugees from Partition, resolving massive poverty, and uniting a highly diverse population.</li>
                <li><strong>Constitution (Jan 1950):</strong> Instituted Universal Adult Franchise, Equality Before Law,
                    and special reservations for the lowest castes (abolishing untouchability). Adopted English
                    alongside Hindi to prevent Southern alienation.</li>
                <li><strong>Linguistic States:</strong> Potti Sriramulu's fast unto death forced the creation of
                    <strong>Andhra (1953)</strong>. The States Reorganisation Commission (1956) subsequently redrew

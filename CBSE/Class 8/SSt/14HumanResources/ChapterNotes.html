        </div>
        <div class="key-term">
            Nature's bounty becomes significant only when people find it useful. It is people with their demands and
            abilities that turn them into 'resources'. Hence, <strong>human resource</strong> is the ultimate resource.
            Healthy, educated, and motivated people develop resources as per their requirements.
        </div>

        <h2>🌍 PART 2: Distribution of Population</h2>
        <p>The pattern in which people are spread across the earth surface is known as the <strong>pattern of population
                distribution</strong>. The distribution is extremely uneven.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More than 90% of the world’s population lives in about 30% of the land surface.</li>
            <li>Some areas are very crowded (South and South East Asia, Europe, and North Eastern North America), while
                others are sparsely populated (high altitudes, tropical deserts, high mountains, areas of equatorial
                forests).</li>
            <li>Almost three-quarters of the world’s people live in two continents: <strong>Asia and Africa</strong>.
                (China and India are the world's most populous countries).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Density of Population</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Population Density</strong> is the number of people living in a unit area of the earth’s surface. It
            is normally expressed as per square kilometre (sq km).
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The average density of population in the whole world is 51 persons per sq km.</li>
            <li>South Central Asia has the highest density of population, followed by East and South East Asia.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Topography:</strong> People prefer living on plains rather than
                                mountains/plateaus because plains are suitable for farming and manufacturing (e.g.,
                                Ganga plains are heavily crowded; Andes/Alps are sparsely populated).</li>
                            <li><strong>Climate:</strong> People avoid extreme climates (very hot/very cold like Sahara
                                desert, Russian polar regions).</li>
                            <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Fertile soils provide good land for agriculture (e.g.,
                                Brahmaputra, Nile).</li>
                            <li><strong>Water & Minerals:</strong> Areas with abundant fresh water and mineral deposits
                                attract more people (diamond mines in South Africa, oil in Middle East).</li>
                        </ul>

        <h2>📈 PART 4: Population Change</h2>
        <p>Population change refers to change in the number of people during a specific time. For extremely long periods
            of human history, the population grew very slowly (due to diseases, poor medical facilities, insufficient
            food).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Population Explosion:</strong> In the 20th century, with better food supplies and medicine,
                deaths went down dramatically, while the number of births remained fairly high, causing explosive
                population growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Birth Rate:</strong> Measured as the number of live births per 1,000 people.</li>
            <li><strong>Death Rate:</strong> Measured as the number of deaths per 1,000 people.</li>
            <li><strong>Migration:</strong> Movement of people in and out of an area. <em>Emigrants</em> are people who
                leave a country. <em>Immigrants</em> are those who arrive in a country.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="key-term">
            The difference between the birth rate and the death rate of a country is called the <strong>natural growth
                rate</strong>. The massive population increase is mainly due to the rapid decline in the death rate.

        <p>How crowded a country is has little to do with its level of economic development (both Bangladesh and Japan
            are densely populated, but Japan is highly developed). We need to study the <strong>composition</strong> of

        <ul>
            <li>The total population divided into various age groups (e.g. 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years).</li>
            <li>The percentage of total population subdivided into males and females in each of those groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Shape Analysis:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Broad at the base, narrow at the top:</strong> Indicates high birth rates and high death
                        rates. Very few children reach adulthood (e.g., Kenya).</li>
                    <li><strong>Broad base, thick middle, narrow top:</strong> High birth rates, but falling death rates
                        (especially in younger age groups). Indicates a young, growing workforce (e.g., India).</li>
                    <li><strong>Narrow base, narrow top, bulging middle:</strong> Low birth rates and low death rates.
                        Represents a mature workforce with an aging population (e.g., Japan).</li>

            A <strong>Constitution</strong> is a written document that lays down the basic rules and regulations for
            people and the government in the country to follow.
        </div>
        <p>Today, most countries in the world have a Constitution. A Constitution serves several crucial purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forming Ideals:</strong> It lays out certain ideals that form the basis of the kind of country
                that we, as citizens, aspire to live in. It tells us what the fundamental nature of our society is.</li>
            <li><strong>Defining Political System:</strong> It defines the nature of a country’s political system (For
                example, whether it is a monarchy or a democracy).</li>
            <li><strong>Guards against Misuse of Power:</strong> In a democracy, we choose our leaders. However, there
                is always a possibility that these leaders might misuse their authority. The Constitution provides
                safeguards against this.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection of Minorities:</strong> It ensures that a dominant group does not use its power
                against other, less powerful people or groups (preventing the tyranny of the majority).</li>
            <li><strong>Saves us from Ourselves:</strong> Sometimes we might feel strongly about an issue that might go
                against our larger interests. The Constitution helps protect us against decisions that could alter its
                basic democratic structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📜 PART 2: Key Features of the Indian Constitution</h2>
        <p>The Indian Constitution was drafted by the Constituent Assembly, comprising 300 individuals who met between
            1946 and 1949. They had the huge task of keeping in mind India's incredible diversity, language, religion,
            and the need to eradicate poverty.</p>

        <h3>1. Federalism</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This refers to the <strong>existence of more than one level of government</strong> in the country. In
                India, we have governments at the state level and at the centre. Panchayati Raj is the third tier of
                government.</li>
            <li>Federalism ensures that decisions are not just made in New Delhi for everyone; states have the autonomy
                to make decisions on specific local issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Parliamentary Form of Government</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Constitution guarantees <strong>universal adult suffrage</strong> for all citizens (every adult has
                the right to vote).</li>
            <li>This means the people of India have a direct role in electing their representatives to the Parliament.
                Every citizen, irrespective of their social background, can also contest in elections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Separation of Powers</h3>
        <p>According to the Constitution, there are <strong>three organs</strong> of government to prevent the misuse of
            power. Each organ acts as a check on the other two (system of checks and balances):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Legislature:</strong> Refers to our elected representatives who make the laws.</li>
            <li><strong>The Executive:</strong> A smaller group of people who are responsible for implementing laws and
                running the government.</li>
            <li><strong>The Judiciary:</strong> Refers to the system of courts in this country. It interprets the laws
                and settles disputes.</li>
        </ul>

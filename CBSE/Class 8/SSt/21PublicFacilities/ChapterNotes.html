                style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A stark contrast image: On the left, a beautiful high-rise apartment complex with
                manicured lawns being watered endlessly by a sprinkler. On the right, a slum where a huge line of
                residents is waiting for a single municipal water tanker. Shows inequality in public facilities.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The situation in Chennai is illustrative of water supply issues across India. While senior government
            officials in areas like Anna Nagar enjoy 24/7 tap water, people living in slums like Saidapet face severe
            acute shortages, getting water occasionally from a single shared tap or relying wholly on expensive private
            water tankers.</p>

        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Water as a Fundamental Right:</strong> The Constitution of India recognizes the right to water as
            being a part of the Right to Life under <strong>Article 21</strong>. It means that it is the right of every
            person, whether rich or poor, to have sufficient amounts of water to fulfill their daily needs at a price
            they can afford. It means there should be <em>universal access</em> to water.
        </div>
        <p>Safe drinking water can prevent many water-related diseases (like diarrhea, dysentery, cholera). India has
            one of the largest numbers of cases of diseases linked to poor water quality.</p>

        <h2>🏫 PART 2: What are Public Facilities?</h2>
        <p>Water is a public facility. Other essential public facilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Hospitals, clinics, and vaccination drives.</li>
            <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Sewage systems, public toilets, and garbage collection.</li>
            <li><strong>Electricity:</strong> Power supply to homes, streets, and factories.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Transport:</strong> Buses, trains, and metros.</li>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Government schools and colleges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Characteristic of a Public Facility</h3>
        <p>The important characteristic of a public facility is that once it is provided, <strong>its benefits can be
                shared by many people</strong>. For instance, a school in a village will enable many children to get
            educated. Similarly, setting up a power grid will immensely benefit agriculture (running tubewells) and
            small workshops.</p>

        <h2>🏛️ PART 3: The Government's Role</h2>
        <p>Given that public facilities are so important, someone must carry the responsibility of providing these to
            the people. <strong>This ‘someone’ is the government.</strong></p>

        <div class="warn-box">
            <div class="box-title">Why not Private Companies?</div>
            Private companies operate for <strong>profit</strong> in the market. There is no profit to be had in
            cleaning drains or running an anti-malaria campaign. A private company will only be interested in things
            that make massive profits, like setting up a private hospital or school, which are unaffordable for the vast
            majority of the population.
            <br><br>
            Since basic facilities are linked to our basic needs and the Right to Life, a democratic government cannot
            abandon its duty to provide them to save the poor from deprivation.
        </div>

        <h3>Where does the government get the money for public facilities?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Every year, the government presents the <strong>budget</strong> in the Parliament.</li>
            <li>The main source of revenue for the government is the <strong>taxes collected from the people</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>The government is empowered to collect these taxes and use them for running public services (funding
                schools, creating water pipelines, developing roads).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>⚠️ PART 4: The Reality of Water Supply in India</h2>
        <p>There are great inequalities in water supply.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There’s a shortfall in government water supply. To cross this burden, private companies step in,
                exploiting the situation by selling bottled water and running tanker services at exorbitant prices.</li>
            <li>The rich can buy water; they simply dig borewells or purchase bottled water. The poor suffer heavily.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Case of Privatisation:</strong> In places like Bolivia (South America), the government handed
                over water supply to a private company. The company doubled water prices abruptly. It led to massive
                riots and protests until the government was forced to cancel the contract and take the water supply
                back.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="summary-box">
            <h2>📌 Chapter Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Facilities:</strong> Essential services like water, sanitation, healthcare, public
                    transport, and education. Once provided, their benefits multiply across society.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Life:</strong> Safe drinking water and healthcare are not luxuries, they are
                    Fundamental Rights (Article 21) necessary for human survival.</li>
                <li><strong>Government Responsibility:</strong> Providing public facilities is the core duty of the
                    government. They fund these through taxes.</li>
                <li><strong>Private Sector Failings:</strong> Private companies operate purely for profit, meaning they
                    will not provide cheap or free access to the poor. Privatizing basic water has caused riots globally
                    (e.g., Bolivia).</li>
                <li><strong>Inequality:</strong> Unfortunately, in Indian cities, there is massive inequality in access.
                    Wealthy neighbourhoods get 24-hour supply while slums grapple with disease and shortages.</li>

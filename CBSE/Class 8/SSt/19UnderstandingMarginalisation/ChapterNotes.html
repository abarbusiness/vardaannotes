            In the NCERT Civics textbook, this is "Chapter 5". However, in our overall SST sequence, it is listed as
            Chapter 19.

        <h2>📖 PART 1: What does it mean to be Socially Marginalised?</h2>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Social Exclusion Concept"
                style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A conceptual visual showing a large group of people forming a circle in the center,
                enjoying resources and wealth. Outside the circle, a few diverse individuals are pushed to the 'margins'
                or edges, looking in. Highlights the feeling of exclusion and lack of access.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="key-term">
            To be <strong>marginalised</strong> is to be forced to occupy the sides or fringes and thus not be at the
            centre of things. It is about feeling excluded.
        </div>
        <p>In society, there are groups of people or communities who may have the experience of being excluded. Their
            marginalisation can be because they speak a different language, follow different customs, or belong to a
            different religious group from the majority community. They may also feel marginalised because they are
            poor, considered to be of 'low' social status, and viewed as being less human than others.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marginalisation results directly in communities having a low social status.</li>
            <li>It leads to them not having equal access to education and other resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🌳 PART 2: Who are Adivasis?</h2>
        <p>The term <strong>Adivasi</strong> literally means ‘original inhabitants’. They are communities who lived, and
            often continue to live, in close association with forests. Around 8% of India’s population is Adivasi.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rich Diversity:</strong> Adivasi societies are very distinct because there is often very little
                hierarchy among them. This makes them radically different from communities organized around principles
                of caste or ruled by kings.</li>
            <li><strong>Religion:</strong> They practice a range of tribal religions distinct from Islam, Hinduism, and
                Christianity. These often involve the worship of ancestors, village, and nature spirits. (However,
                during the 19th and 20th centuries, large numbers converted to Christianity).</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> They have their own languages (e.g., Santhali), which have significantly
                influenced the formation of mainstream Indian languages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stereotyping and Marginalisation of Adivasis</h3>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Adivasi Displacement from Forests"
                style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> An emotive illustration comparing two scenes: Left side shows an Adivasi family
                living harmoniously in a lush, green forest gathering herbs. Right side shows the same family displaced
                in a crowded, dirty urban slum after their forest was cleared for a massive mining project.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>In India, we usually showcase Adivasi communities holding stereotypical images – in colourful costumes,
                headgear, and dancing. We often mistakenly believe that they are exotic, primitive, and backward.</li>
            <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> From the 1830s onwards, due to the need for timber, agriculture, and
                mining operations (especially in regions like Chota Nagpur), Adivasis have been forcefully displaced
                from their ancestral lands.</li>
            <li>Losing their lands and access to the forest meant losing their main sources of livelihood and food. Many
                migrated to cities in search of work, where they are employed for very low wages.</li>
            <li>As a result, they get caught in a cycle of poverty and deprivation (around 45% of tribal groups in rural
                areas and 35% in urban areas live below the poverty line).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🕌 PART 3: Minorities and Marginalisation</h2>
        <div class="key-term">
            The term <strong>minority</strong> refers to communities that are numerically small in relation to the rest
            of the population. However, it encompasses issues of power, access to resources, and has social and cultural
            dimensions.
        </div>
        <p>Safeguards are needed to protect minority communities against the possibility of being culturally dominated
            by the majority. They also protect them against any discrimination and disadvantage they may face.</p>

        <h3>Muslims and Marginalisation</h3>
        <p>According to the 2011 census, Muslims form 14.2% of India’s population. Over the years, they have been
            considered as a marginalised community in India because they have been deprived of the benefits of
            socio-economic development compared to other communities.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They lag behind in basic amenities (like pucca houses, electricity, and tap water).</li>
            <li>They have lower literacy rates compared to other religious groups.</li>
            <li>They are under-represented in public employment.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Stereotyping:</strong> Some identify Muslims simply by wearing a explicitly religious
                signs (like a burqa or long beard). Because of this, they tend to be identified differently and some
                people think they are not like the 'rest of us'. This often becomes an excuse to treat them unfairly,
                leading to ghettoisation.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="summary-box">
            <h2>📌 Chapter Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marginalisation:</strong> Being pushed to the fringes of society, denied equal access to
                    resources, education, and social status. This is often driven by differences in language, religion,
                    or poverty.</li>
                <li><strong>Adivasis (Original Inhabitants):</strong> Close-knit communities deeply connected to
                    forests. They lack a highly hierarchical caste system.</li>
                <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Mass industrialisation, mining, and dam building led to the forced
                    removal of Adivasis from their forests. They lost their livelihood and fell into cycles of severe
                    poverty.</li>
                <li><strong>Minorities (e.g., Muslims):</strong> Numerically smaller communities. The Constitution
                    protects them from the tyranny of the majority. Sadly, communities like Muslims suffer from
                    socio-economic backwardness, lower literacy, and ghettoisation due to stereotyping.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Marginalised communities are not just demanding resources, they are
                    demanding <em>respect and dignity</em>.</li>

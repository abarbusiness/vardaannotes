        </div>

        <h2>📖 PART 1: How the British saw Education</h2>
        <p>The British felt they had a cultural mission in India: they had to "civilise the natives" and change their
            customs and values using education. However, different British thinkers had different ideas on <em>what kind
                of education</em> should be given.</p>

        <h3>1. The Tradition of Orientalism</h3>
        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>Orientalists</strong> were scholars who acquired a profound knowledge of the language and culture of
            Asia (the Orient).
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1783, <strong>William Jones</strong> arrived in Calcutta as a junior judge. He was a linguist who
                knew Greek, Latin, French, English, Arabic, and Persian. Soon, he started studying Sanskrit.</li>
            <li>Along with Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed, he discovered the ancient Indian heritage,
                deciphering ancient texts. They set up the <strong>Asiatic Society of Bengal</strong> and started a
                journal called <em>Asiatick Researches</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Their logic:</strong> To rule India properly, the British needed to understand and respect
                ancient Indian texts. Hindus and Muslims should be taught what they were already familiar with
                (Sanskrit/Persian literature and poetry), not subjects that were alien to them. They believed this would
                win the hearts of the "natives."</li>
            <li><strong>Actions taken:</strong> Warren Hastings helped set up a <em>Madrasa</em> in Calcutta (1781) to
                promote study of Arabic, Persian, and Islamic law. In 1791, the <em>Hindu College</em> was established
                in Benaras to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. "Grave Errors of the East" (The Anglicists)</h3>
        <div
            style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: var(--card-shadow);">

            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A 19th-century colonial British classroom in India, showing Thomas Macaulay holding
                an English literature book, addressing Indian students who are dressed in traditional attire but
                studying Western science and English. A clash of cultures aesthetic.</p>
        </div>
        <p>From the early 19th century, many British officials strongly criticized the Orientalist vision of learning.
            They said that Eastern literature was non-serious, light-hearted, and full of errors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>James Mill:</strong> He attacked the Orientalists. He believed the aim of education shouldn't be
                to teach what the natives wanted or respected, but to teach what was useful and practical. Indians
                should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances of the West.</li>
            <li><strong>Thomas Babington Macaulay:</strong> In 1835, he famously said that <em>"a single shelf of a good
                    European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia."</em> He urged the
                British government to stop wasting public money promoting Oriental learning. He wanted a class of
                persons "Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect."
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The English Education Act of 1835</h3>
        <div class="info-box">
            <div class="box-title">Macaulay's Minute (1835)</div>
            Following Macaulay's recommendations, the English Education Act was passed in 1835. It made <strong>English
                the medium of instruction for higher education</strong> and stopped the promotion of Oriental
            institutions (Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College). English textbooks began to be produced for
            schools.
        </div>

        <h2>📜 PART 2: Education for Commerce (Wood's Despatch)</h2>
        <p>In 1854, the Court of Directors of the EIC in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in
            India. Since it was issued by <strong>Charles Wood</strong> (President of the Board of Control), it became
            known as <strong>Wood's Despatch</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It sharply criticized Oriental knowledge and emphasized the practical benefits of a system of
                <strong>European learning</strong>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Economic rationale:</strong> It argued that European learning would enable Indians to recognize
                the advantages of trade and commerce and show them the importance of developing the country's resources.
                It would change their tastes, creating a demand for British goods.</li>
            <li><strong>Moral rationale:</strong> It argued that European learning would improve the moral character of
                Indians, making them truthful, honest, and reliable civil servants for the Company.</li>
            <li><strong>Action taken:</strong> Education departments were set up by the government to extend control
                over all matters regarding education. Universities were established in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay in
                1857. Attempts were made to bring changes within the school education system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🏫 PART 3: What Happened to the Local Schools?</h2>
        <div

            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>AI PROMPT FOR
                    IMAGE:</strong> A traditional Indian village 'Pathshala' (school). A respected guru (teacher) sits
                under a large banyan tree teaching a group of 10-15 rural students who are sitting on the ground writing
                on traditional wooden slates. A peaceful, rural 19th-century setting.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Report of William Adam (1830s)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scottish missionary, William Adam, toured Bengal and Bihar to report on the progress of vernacular
                schools.</li>
            <li>He found over 1 lakh <strong>pathshalas</strong>. These were small (usually less than 20 students), but
                the total count of children was over 20 lakh. They were set up by wealthy people or local communities,
                or sometimes started by a single teacher (<em>guru</em>).</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible System:</strong> There were no fixed fees, printed books, separate building,
                benches/chairs, blackboards, or regular timetables/annual exams. Classes were held under a banyan tree,
                in a village shop, or the guru's home. The system was suited to local needs—for instance, <em>classes
                    did not run during harvest time</em> when rural children had to work in the fields.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>New Routines, New Rules (After 1854)</h3>
        <p>After 1854, the Company decided to "improve" the system of vernacular education through <strong>order and
                routine</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It appointed government <em>pandits</em> to look after 4-5 schools, encouraging the gurus to submit
                periodic reports and take classes according to regular timetables.</li>
            <li>Teaching was now based on textbooks, and learning was tested through an annual examination system.</li>
            <li>Students had to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of
                discipline.</li>
            <li><strong>The Negative Impact:</strong> Pathshalas that accepted the new rules got government grants.
                Those that didn't found it hard to compete. More importantly, the new system demanded <em>regular
                    attendance</em>, even during harvest time. Children of poor peasant families could no longer attend
                school, leading to dropping out. Inability to attend was seen as poor discipline.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🤝 PART 4: The Agenda for a National Education</h2>
        <p>By the 19th century, some Indians were impressed with Western education and felt the British could help
            modernise India. Others strongly opposed it and wanted an education system rooted in Indian culture.</p>

        <h3>1. Mahatma Gandhi: "English Education has enslaved us"</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Gandhi argued that colonial education created a sense of inferiority in the minds of Indians. It made
                them see Western civilisation as superior and destroyed their pride in their own culture.</li>
            <li>"It was a poison," he said. Educated Indians began admiring British rule.</li>
            <li>He wanted an education that could help Indians recover their sense of dignity. During the national
                movement, he urged students to leave educational institutions.</li>
            <li>He strongly believed education should be <strong>in Indian languages</strong>. Reading and writing
                English was alienating.</li>
            <li>He emphasised <strong>practical knowledge</strong>. Education shouldn't only be reading/writing text;
                people had to work with their hands, learn a craft, and know how different things operated. This would
                develop their mind and capacity to understand.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Rabindranath Tagore: The "Abode of Peace" (Shantiniketan)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As a child, Tagore hated going to school. He found it suffocating and oppressive. The school appeared
                like a prison.</li>
            <li>When he grew up, he wanted to set up a school where the child was happy, free, and creative—able to
                explore their own thoughts and desires. He felt childhood ought to be a time of self-learning, outside
                the rigid restrictions of British schools.</li>
            <li>In <strong>1901</strong>, he established <strong>Shantiniketan</strong>, located in a rural setting 100
                km from Calcutta (an "abode of peace"), where living in harmony with nature, children could cultivate
                their natural creativity.</li>
            <li><strong>Gandhi vs. Tagore:</strong> Both wanted national education, but there were differences. Gandhi
                was highly critical of Western civilisation and its worship of machines/technology. Tagore wanted to
                combine elements of modern Western civilisation with what he saw as the best within Indian tradition. At
                Shantiniketan, they taught science and technology along with art, music, and dance.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>📌 Chapter Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Orientalists:</strong> Supported traditional Indian learning (Sanskrit/Persian) to win
                    hearts (e.g., William Jones). Set up Calcutta Madrasa and Hindu College in Benaras.</li>
                <li><strong>Anglicists:</strong> Fiercely opposed Orientalists. James Mill and Thomas Macaulay argued
                    for teaching practical Western science and literature in English. Led to the English Education Act
                    (1835).</li>
                <li><strong>Wood's Despatch (1854):</strong> Cemented European education. Argued it would improve moral
                    character (producing honest clerks) and create tastes that would boost demand for British goods. Led
                    to establishment of Universities (1857).</li>
                <li><strong>Pathshalas:</strong> Local flexible schools (studied by William Adam). Disrupted by British

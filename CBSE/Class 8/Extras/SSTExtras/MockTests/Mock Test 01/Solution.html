                <ul>

                        needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> It is required because many resources (like coal and petroleum)
                        are non-renewable and limited. If we use them recklessly, they will get exhausted, leaving

                The British believed that the act of writing was very important. Every instruction, plan, policy
                decision, agreement, and investigation had to be clearly written up. They preserved these documents in
                record rooms (archives) because they served as a permanent record that could be studied, debated, and
                used as a reference for future administration.

            <div class="question-text">14. (A) Classify industries on the basis of Raw Materials. Explain each category
                with a suitable example.</div>
            <div class="answer-text">
                Industries are classified into four types based on the raw materials they use:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Agro-based Industries:</strong> These industries use plant and animal-based products as
                        their raw materials.<br><em>Example:</em> Cotton textile, food processing, dairy products.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mineral-based Industries:</strong> These are primary industries that use mineral ores as
                        their raw materials. The products of these industries feed other
                        industries.<br><em>Example:</em> Iron and steel industry (uses iron ore), cement industry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marine-based Industries:</strong> These industries use products from the sea and oceans
                        as raw materials.<br><em>Example:</em> Processing sea food, manufacturing fish oil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forest-based Industries:</strong> These industries utilize forest produce as raw

            <div class="question-text">14. (B) What is the Revolt of 1857? Explain the major causes (Political,
                Economic, and Social) that led to the uprising against British rule.</div>
            <div class="answer-text">
                The Revolt of 1857 was a major uprising against the rule of the British East India Company, often called
                the "First War of Indian Independence."<br><br>
                <strong>Causes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Political Causes:</strong> The British policy of expansion, particularly the 'Doctrine
                        of Lapse' introduced by Lord Dalhousie, created fear among Indian rulers. Many kingdoms like
                        Jhansi and Satara were annexed, causing resentment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Causes:</strong> Heavy taxation on peasants and the destruction of traditional
                        Indian handicrafts and industries led to widespread poverty and misery. Landlords and zamindars
                        also lost their lands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social and Religious Causes:</strong> The British passed laws to stop Sati and
                        encouraged widow remarriage. They also promoted Western education and Christianity. Indians felt
                        that the British were destroying their social customs and religion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Military Causes (Immediate):</strong> The introduction of the Enfield rifle was the
                        spark. The cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs, which insulted the religious
                        sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers (sepoys).</li>

        <!-- 1. Culture  -->
        <div class="sol-block">
            <span class="q-ref">1. Role of Culture in European Nationalism</span>
            <div class="solution-content">
                Culture played a vital role in creating the idea of the nation in Europe in several ways:
                <br><strong>(i) Romanticism:</strong> This was a cultural movement which sought to develop a particular
                form of nationalist sentiment. Romantic artists and poets generally criticized the glorification of
                reason and science and focused instead on emotions, intuition, and mystical feelings. Their effort was
                to create a sense of a shared collective heritage, a common cultural past, as the basis of a nation.
                <br><strong>(ii) Folk Culture (Das Volk):</strong> German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder claimed
                that true German culture was to be discovered among the common people &mdash; <em>das volk</em>. It was
                through folk songs, folk poetry, and folk dances that the true spirit of the nation
                (<em>volksgeist</em>) was popularized. So collecting and recording these forms of folk culture was
                essential to the project of nation-building.
                <br><strong>(iii) Language as a Weapon:</strong> Language played an important role in developing
                nationalist sentiments. For example, in Poland, language was used as a weapon of national resistance
                against Russian dominance. The use of Polish came to be seen as a symbol of the struggle against Russian
                rule.

        <div class="sol-block">
            <span class="q-ref">2. Economic Hardships in Europe (1830s)</span>
            <div class="solution-content">
                The 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe. The justification lies in the following
                factors:
                <br><strong>(i) Population Explosion:</strong> The first half of the nineteenth century saw an enormous
                increase in population all over Europe. In most countries, there were more seekers of jobs than
                employment.
                <br><strong>(ii) Rural to Urban Migration:</strong> Population from rural areas migrated to the cities
                to live in overcrowded slums, leading to poor living conditions.
                <br><strong>(iii) Stiff Competition:</strong> Small producers in towns were often faced with stiff
                competition from imports of cheap machine-made goods from England, where industrialization was more
                advanced.
                <br><strong>(iv) Feudal Dues:</strong> In those regions of Europe where the aristocracy still enjoyed
                power, peasants struggled under the burden of feudal dues and obligations.
                <br><strong>(v) Rise in Food Prices:</strong> The rise of food prices or a year of bad harvest (like the
                potato famine) led to widespread pauperism in town and country.

        <!-- 3. Balkan Conflict -->
        <div class="sol-block">
            <span class="q-ref">3. Conflict in the Balkans</span>
            <div class="solution-content">
                The Balkans became an area of intense conflict because:
                <br><strong>(i) Ethnic Diversity:</strong> A region of geographical and ethnic variation comprising
                modern-day Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia,
                and Montenegro whose inhabitants were broadly known as the Slavs.
                <br><strong>(ii) Ottoman Disintegration:</strong> A large part of the Balkans was under the control of
                the Ottoman Empire. The spread of the ideas of romantic nationalism in the Balkans together with the
                disintegration of the Ottoman Empire made this region very explosive.
                <br><strong>(iii) Struggles for Independence:</strong> One by one, its European subject nationalities
                broke away from its control and declared independence. The Balkan peoples based their claims for
                independence or political rights on nationality and used history to prove that they had once been
                independent but had subsequently been subjugated by foreign powers.
                <br><strong>(iv) Big Power Rivalry:</strong> The Balkans also became the scene of big power rivalry.
                Matters were complicated because the Balkans also became the scene of big power rivalry. Russia,
                Germany, England, Austro-Hungary—each power was keen on countering the hold of other powers over the
                Balkans, and extending its own control over the area. This led to a series of wars in the region and
                finally the First World War.

            <span class="q-ref">4. Slowdown of Non-Cooperation Movement in Cities</span>
            <div class="solution-content">
                The movement in the cities gradually slowed down for a variety of reasons:
                <br><strong>(i) Expensive Khadi:</strong> Khadi cloth was often more expensive than mass-produced mill
                cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it. They could not boycott mill cloth for too long.
                <br><strong>(ii) Lack of Alternative Institutions:</strong> Similarly, the boycott of British
                institutions posed a problem. For the movement to be successful, alternative Indian institutions had to
                be set up so that they could be used in place of the British ones. These were slow to come up.
                <br><strong>(iii) Return to Status Quo:</strong> So students and teachers began trickling back to
                government schools and lawyers joined back work in government courts. They had to return to their jobs
                for livelihood.

                Gandhiji decided to launch a nationwide Satyagraha against the proposed Rowlatt Act (1919) because:
                <br><strong>(i) Hurried Passing:</strong> This Act had been hurriedly passed through the Imperial
                Legislative Council despite the united opposition of the Indian members.
                <br><strong>(ii) Repressive Powers:</strong> It gave the government enormous powers to repress political
                activities.
                <br><strong>(iii) Detention without Trial:</strong> It allowed detention of political prisoners without
                trial for two years. This was seen as a "Black Act" that denied civil liberties and fundamental rights.

            <div class="solution-content">
                <strong>(i) Reaction to Colonial Policies:</strong> During the First World War, Indian merchants and
                industrialists had made huge profits and become powerful. They reacted against colonial policies that
                restricted business activities.
                <br><strong>(ii) Demand for Protection:</strong> They wanted protection against imports of foreign
                goods, and a rupee-sterling foreign exchange ratio that would discourage imports.
                <br><strong>(iii) Organization:</strong> To organize business interests, they formed the Indian
                Industrial and Commercial Congress in 1920 and the Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and
                Industries (FICCI) in 1927.
                <br><strong>(iv) Financial Support:</strong> Led by prominent industrialists like Purshottamdas
                Thakurdas and G. D. Birla, the industrialists attacked colonial control over the Indian economy, and
                supported the Civil Disobedience Movement when it was first launched. They gave financial assistance and
                refused to buy or sell imported goods.

            <div class="solution-content">
                Many historians argue that print culture created the conditions within which the French Revolution
                occurred. Three types of arguments are usually advanced:
                <br><strong>(i) Popularized Enlightenment Ideas:</strong> Print popularized the ideas of the
                Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire and Rousseau. Collectively, their writings provided a critical
                commentary on tradition, superstition, and despotism. They argued for the rule of reason rather than
                custom, and demanded that everything be judged through the application of reason and rationality.
                <br><strong>(ii) Culture of Dialogue:</strong> Print created a new culture of dialogue and debate. All
                values, norms, and institutions were re-evaluated and discussed by a public that had become aware of the
                power of reason, and recognized the need to question existing ideas and beliefs.
                <br><strong>(iii) Criticism of Monarchy:</strong> By the 1780s there was an outpouring of literature
                that mocked the royalty and criticized their morality. In the process, it raised questions about the
                existing social order. Cartoons and caricatures typically suggested that the monarchy remained absorbed
                in sensual pleasures while the common people suffered immense hardships.

                <strong>(i) Debates:</strong> From the early nineteenth century, there were intense debates around
                religious issues. Different groups confronted the changes happening within colonial society in different
                ways, and offered a variety of new interpretations of the beliefs of different religions.
                <br><strong>(ii) Public Participation:</strong> Some criticized existing practices and campaigned for
                reform, while others countered the arguments of reformers. These debates were carried out in public and
                in print. Printed tracts and newspapers not only spread the new ideas, but they shaped the nature of the
                debate.
                <br><strong>(iii) Pan-Indian Identity:</strong> A wider public could now participate in these public
                discussions and express their views. New ideas emerged through these clashes of opinions. This allowed
                people from different parts of India to connect with each other, realizing their shared grievances and
                shared national identity.

                <strong>Moral Reason:</strong> Power sharing is the very spirit of democracy. A democratic rule involves
                sharing power with those affected by its exercise, and who have to live with its effects. People have a
                right to be consulted on how they are to be governed. A legitimate government is one where citizens,
                through participation, acquire a stake in the system. Ignoring the views of minority groups can

            <div class="solution-content">
                The real success of federalism in India can be attributed to the nature of democratic politics in our
                country.
                <br><strong>(i) Linguistic States:</strong> The creation of linguistic states was the first and a major
                test for democratic politics in our country. It ensured that people who spoke the same language lived in
                the same state.
                <br><strong>(ii) Language Policy:</strong> A second test for Indian federation is the language policy.
                Our Constitution did not give the status of national language to any one language. Hindi was identified
                as the official language. Besides Hindi, there are 21 other languages recognized as Scheduled Languages
                by the Constitution.
                <br><strong>(iii) Centre-State Relations:</strong> Restructuring the Centre-State relations is one more
                way in which federalism has been strengthened in practice. The rise of regional political parties and
                coalition governments has led to a new culture of power sharing.

                <br><strong>(i) Regular Elections:</strong> It is constitutionally mandatory to hold regular elections
                to local government bodies.
                <br><strong>(ii) Reservation:</strong> Seats are reserved in the elected bodies and the executive heads

                76 per cent among men.

                man every day. Yet much of her work is not paid and therefore often not valued.
                <br><strong>(iii) Sex Ratio:</strong> In many parts of India parents prefer to have sons and find ways
                to have the girl child aborted before she is born. This has led to a decline in child sex ratio.
                <br><strong>(iv) Representation:</strong> The percentage of elected women members in Lok Sabha has
                touched 14.36 per cent of its total strength for the first time in 2019. Their share in the state

                <br><strong>(ii) Policy Making:</strong> Parties bring various representatives together so that a
                responsible government could be formed. They provide a mechanism to support or restrain the government,
                make policies, justify or oppose them.
                <br><strong>(iii) Accountability:</strong> Without parties, every candidate in the elections will be
                independent. No one will be able to make any promises to the people about any major policy changes. The
                government may be formed, but its utility will remain ever uncertain. Elected representatives will be
                accountable to their constituency for what they do in the locality. But no one will be responsible for

            <div class="solution-content">
                Democracy is seen to be good in principle but involves challenges in practice:
                <br><strong>(i) Moral Good:</strong> It promotes equality among citizens, enhances the dignity of the
                individual, improves the quality of decision-making, and provides a method to resolve conflicts.
                <br><strong>(ii) Accountability vs Efficiency:</strong> Democratic governments are accountable,
                responsive, and legitimate. However, they may be slow, less efficient, not always very responsive or
                clean compared to dictatorships in terms of quick decision making (which ignores public opinion).
                <br><strong>(iii) Economic Growth:</strong> Rates of economic growth in poor countries under
                dictatorship have been slightly higher. However, democracy guarantees political and social rights which
                dictatorships do not.
                <br><strong>(iv) Conclusion:</strong> The difference in the rates of economic development between less
                developed countries with dictatorships and democracies is negligible. Overall, we cannot say that
                democracy overlaps with economic growth, but it is better than any other form of government because of
                its non-economic benefits.

                <br><strong>(ii) Development of Primary/Secondary Sectors:</strong> The development of agriculture and

                <br><strong>(ii) Example:</strong> Laxmi owns a plot of 2 hectares. All 5 members of her family work in
                the plot throughout the year. They have nowhere else to go. Each one is doing some work but no one is
                fully employed. If two members move out to work in a factory, the yield of the plot remains the same,
                but the family income increases. This is disguised unemployment.

            <div class="solution-content">
                The Reserve Bank of India supervises the functioning of formal sources of loans:
                <br><strong>(i) Cash Balance:</strong> The RBI monitors the banks in actually maintaining cash balance
                (CRR).
                <br><strong>(ii) Loan Distribution:</strong> The RBI sees that the banks give loans not just to
                profit-making businesses and traders but also to small cultivators, small scale industries, to small
                borrowers etc.
                <br><strong>(iii) Reporting:</strong> Periodically, banks have to submit information to the RBI on how
                much they are lending, to whom, at what interest rate, etc. This prevents unfair practices.

            <div class="solution-content">
                Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has played a major role:
                <br><strong>(i) Instant Communication:</strong> Telecommunication facilities (telegraph, telephone
                including mobile phones, fax) are used to contact one another around the world, to access information
                instantly, and to communicate from remote areas.
                <br><strong>(ii) Outsourcing:</strong> It has facilitated outsourcing of services. A news magazine
                published for London readers can be designed and printed in Delhi. The text is sent through Internet to
                the Delhi office. The designers in Delhi office get orders on how to design the magazine from the office
                in London using telecommunication facilities. The designing is done on a computer. After printing, the
                magazines are sent by air to London.
                <br><strong>(iii) Payment:</strong> Even the payment of money for designing and printing from a bank in
                London to a bank in Delhi is done instantly through the Internet (e-banking).

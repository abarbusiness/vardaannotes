        <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
        <h2>CHAPTER 1: A TRIUMPH OF SURGERY (James Herriot)</h2>

        <div class="theme-box">
            <h3>1. Theme</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overindulgence is Harmful:</strong> Excessive pampering (by Mrs. Pumphrey) can cause more
                    harm than good to those we love.</li>
                <li><strong>Practicality vs. Emotion:</strong> Dr. Herriot's practical, firm approach saves Tricki,
                    while Mrs. Pumphrey's emotional doting nearly kills him.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Detailed Plot Summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Tricki, a small dog, is hugely fat, like a <span
                    class="highlight">"bloated sausage"</span>. His mistress, Mrs. Pumphrey, feeds him malt, cod-liver
                oil, cream cakes, and chocolates, thinking he is malnourished.</li>
            <li><strong>The Diagnosis:</strong> Dr. Herriot sees the dog and warns Mrs. Pumphrey to cut his food and
                give him exercise. She fails to do so due to her love.</li>
            <li><strong>The Collapse:</strong> Tricki stops eating, vomits, and refuses to move. Mrs. Pumphrey calls the
                vet in panic.</li>
            <li><strong>The Cure (The "Surgery"):</strong>
                <br>Dr. Herriot takes Tricki to his surgery (clinic) for a fortnight.
                <br><strong>Day 1-2:</strong> No food, plenty of water.
                <br><strong>Day 3:</strong> Tricki starts showing interest in surroundings and other dogs.
                <br><strong>Recovery:</strong> He joins the "gang" of dogs, fighting for food bowls. He discovers the
                <span class="highlight">"joys of being bowled over"</span>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Temptation:</strong> Mrs. Pumphrey sends fresh eggs, wine, and brandy for Tricki's
                convalescence. Dr. Herriot and his partners enjoy these themselves (a temptation to keep Tricki as a
                permanent guest).</li>
            <li><strong>The Triumph:</strong> In two weeks, Tricki becomes a hard-muscled animal. When Mrs. Pumphrey
                collects him, he leaps into her lap. She cries, <span class="highlight">"Oh, Mr. Herriot, this is a
                    triumph of surgery!"</span></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note-box">
            <h3>3. Character Sketches</h3>
            <p><strong>Mrs. Pumphrey:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Traits:</em> Rich, foolishly indulgent, emotional, impractical but loving.</li>
                <li><em>Evidence:</em> Feeds Tricki incessantly; sends wine/brandy for a dog.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Dr. James Herriot:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Traits:</em> Practical, competent vet, distinct sense of humour, common sense.</li>
                <li><em>Evidence:</em> Knows exactly what Tricki needs (no medicine, just diet control); enjoys the free
                    wine/eggs but dutifully returns the dog.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="pyq-box">
            <h3>4. PYQ Trends & Expert Teacher's Insight</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Question Type:</strong> Often value-based questions on parenting/pet-keeping. <em>"Excessive
                        love is a form of cruelty."</em></li>
                <li><strong>Important Question:</strong> <em>Why was Dr. Herriot tempted to keep Tricki as a permanent
                        guest?</em> (Because of the free wine, eggs, and brandy).</li>
                <li><strong>The Title:</strong> Explain the irony. It wasn't a "surgery" (operation) but a natural
                    recovery, yet Mrs. Pumphrey perceives it as a medical miracle.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>CHAPTER 2: THE THIEF'S STORY (Ruskin Bond)</h2>

        <div class="theme-box">
            <h3>1. Theme</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transformative Power of Trust:</strong> Kindness and trust can reform even a hardened
                    criminal.</li>
                <li><strong>Education vs. Crime:</strong> Hari Singh realizes that education can give him respect, which
                    is more valuable than stolen money.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <li><strong>Age:</strong> 15 years old.</li>
            <li><strong>Skill:</strong> Experienced thief, changes name every month to avoid police/employers.</li>

            <li><strong>Role:</strong> He trusts Hari completely, gives him the key to the door.</li>

        <div class="note-box">
            <h3>3. Plot Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Meeting:</strong> Hari meets Anil at a wrestling match. Wins his confidence with a smile
                    (flattery). Anil agrees to feed him if he can cook.</li>
                <li><strong>The Betrayal:</strong> Hari cooks terrible food, but Anil teaches him to cook and write
                    sentences. Hari steals 1 rupee daily from grocery shopping.</li>
                <li><strong>The Theft:</strong> Anil sells a book and brings home a bundle of notes (600 rupees). He
                    puts it under his mattress. Hari steals it while Anil sleeps.</li>
                <li><strong>The Escape (Or Lack Thereof):</strong> Hari runs to the station but <em>hesitates</em> to
                    board the Lucknow Express. He stands alone on the deserted platform.</li>
                <li><strong>The Realization:</strong> In the rain (symbolic cleansing), Hari realizes that stealing
                    provides short-term gain, but education can make him a "big man". He values Anil's trust.</li>
                <li><strong>The Return:</strong> He creeps back and puts the wet notes back under the mattress.</li>
                <li><strong>The Climax:</strong> Next morning, Anil gives him a 50 rupee note (still wet). Anil says,
                    <span class="highlight">"Now you'll be paid regularly."</span> Anil <em>knew</em> but didn't hand
                    him over. He chose to reform him with silence and trust.

                    to Anil.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Compare Hari Singh with the narrator of "The Hack Driver" (gullibility

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Setup:</strong> Max enters Ausable's room with a gun to steal a report on missiles.</li>
                <li><strong>The Lie:</strong> Ausable calmly creates a fake story about a <span
                        class="highlight">non-existent balcony</span> below his window, complaining that people keep
                    entering through it. He makes Max believe it exists.</li>
                <li><strong>The Knock:</strong> A loud knocking at the door. Ausable lies again: "It's the police."
                    (Actually, it was the waiter, Henry).</li>
                <li><strong>The Panic:</strong> Max, terrified of the police, backs towards the window to hide in the
                    "balcony".</li>
                <li><strong>The Fall:</strong> He jumps out... and screams. There was no balcony. He fell from the sixth
                    floor.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Ausable defeated an armed enemy without raising a finger, just by using
                    his brain.</li>
